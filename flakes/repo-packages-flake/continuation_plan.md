# Continuation Plan

## Problem

The `nix flake update` command is failing with the following error:

```
error: undefined variable 'system'

at /nix/store/11wmhinlk22gwprah9fcbdr5kk31jij4-source/flakes/repo-data-flake/flake.nix:16:9:
```

This error is happening in the `repo-data-flake` which is an input to the `repo-packages-flake`. The `flake.nix` of `repo-data-flake` is not correctly structured. It's not using `eachDefaultSystem` and it's trying to use the `system` variable at the top level.

## What has been tried

*   Hardcoding the system in `repo-packages-flake`.
*   Passing the system to `repo-data-flake` as an argument.
*   Using `callFlake`.

None of these approaches worked because the error happens during the evaluation of `repo-data-flake` itself.

## Next Steps

1.  The source code of `repo-data-flake` has been prefetched and is available at `/nix/store/2x82hyv8ljw2fa18imcv3yl3l5hn4wqc-ai-ml-zk-ops`.
2.  The next step is to inspect the `flake.nix` of `repo-data-flake` which is located at `/nix/store/2x82hyv8ljw2fa18imcv3yl3l5hn4wqc-ai-ml-zk-ops/flakes/repo-data-flake/flake.nix`.
3.  Since we can't read files directly from the nix store, we need to copy the file to the current directory to be able to read it.
4.  Once we have the content of the `flake.nix` of `repo-data-flake`, we can analyze it and create a fixed version of it.
5.  We can then use the `override-input` option of `nix flake update` to point `repo-data-flake` to our fixed local version.
