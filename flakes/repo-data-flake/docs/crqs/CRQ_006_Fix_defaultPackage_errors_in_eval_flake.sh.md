# CRQ-006: Fix defaultPackage errors in eval_flake.sh

## Problem

The `eval_flake.sh` script is failing because it's trying to evaluate the `defaultPackage` of a flake, but our flakes don't have a `defaultPackage` attribute.

## Solution

The solution is to change the command in `eval_flake.sh` to `nix eval --raw .#`. This will evaluate the flake without trying to access a specific output.
