# Description: This script is executed by the Nix flake's test check.
#              It serves as a placeholder to indicate that the Nix-managed
#              build and test process is being invoked. The actual generation
#              of data and building of the default package are handled by
#              Nix derivations.
#
# Usage:
#   This script is primarily called by `nix_test_runner.sh` within a Nix derivation.
#
# Output:
#   - A message indicating the test workflow is being executed.
#
# Rules Adhered To:
#   - Univalent idea: Takes no parameters and "does what I mean" (DWIM).
#
# Nix Flakes Context:
#   This script is part of the hermetic Nix testing environment. Its successful
#   execution within the Nix derivation indicates that the flake is correctly
#   orchestrating the build and test process.
#

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
