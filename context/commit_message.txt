refactor: Integrate data generation into Nix flake and simplify build/test scripts

Refactored `flake.nix` to include a new derivation (`packages.repo2gramJson`)
that generates `2gram.json` within the Nix build system.
Updated `build.sh` and `test.sh` to remove redundant data generation logic,
as this is now handled by Nix. This ensures a fully hermetic and reproducible
data generation and build process within the Nix flake.
