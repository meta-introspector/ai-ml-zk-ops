fix: Correct relative paths in awk-runner-flake/flake.nix

Updated the input paths in `awk-runner-flake/flake.nix` from `path:../<flake-name>` to `path:../../flakes/<flake-name>`.
This resolves the "relative path points outside of its parent's store path" error when building the flake, ensuring correct resolution of sub-flake inputs from the project root.
