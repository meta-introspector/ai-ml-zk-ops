fix: Ensure output directory exists for checks.runTests

Added `mkdir -p $out` to the `buildCommand` for `checks.runTests` in `flake.nix`.
This resolves the "No such file or directory" error encountered when `touch`ing `test_result.txt`,
ensuring the output directory is created before attempting to write to it.
