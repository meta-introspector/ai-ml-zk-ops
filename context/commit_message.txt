fix: Refactor test.sh to remove local log management

Modified `test.sh` to no longer manage local log directories or redirect output to files.
Instead, it now prints directly to stdout, allowing the calling environment (e.g., `nix_test_runner.sh`)
to handle log redirection. This resolves the 'Permission denied' error when running tests within Nix derivations.
