fix: Configure Nix experimental features via NIX_CONFIG and simplify build command

Set `NIX_CONFIG` environment variable to enable `nix-command` and `flakes` experimental features.
Simplified the Nix build command in `run_workflow.sh` to `nix build .#checks.runTests` to address flake resolution issues.
