feat: Refactor Nix flake checks to use dedicated test runner script

Introduced `source/automation/nix_test_runner.sh` to encapsulate the logic for running project tests within Nix derivations.
Updated `flake.nix` to call this new script for the `checks.runTests` output, adhering to the rule of Nix commands only calling scripts.
