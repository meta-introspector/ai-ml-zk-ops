fix: Use placeholder inputs in awk-runner-flake/flake.nix

Modified `awk-runner-flake/flake.nix` to use placeholder URLs for its inputs (`nixpkgs-pinned`, `flake-utils-wrapper`, `repo-data-flake`).
This allows the main `flake.nix` to correctly override these inputs when consuming `awk-runner-flake` as a sub-flake, resolving the "relative path points outside of its parent's store path" error.
