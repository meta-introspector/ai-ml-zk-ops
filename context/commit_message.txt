fix: Use only remote github:meta-introspector URLs in awk-runner-flake/flake.nix

Modified `awk-runner-flake/flake.nix` to strictly use remote `github:meta-introspector` URLs for all its inputs (`nixpkgs-pinned`, `flake-utils-wrapper`, `repo-data-flake`).
This adheres to the project's policy of using only remote `github:meta-introspector` references and resolves previous flake resolution errors.
