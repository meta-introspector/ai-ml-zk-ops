fix: Update nixpkgs input in flake.nix to meta-introspector fork

Corrected the `nixpkgs.url` in `flake.nix` to point to `github:meta-introspector/nixpkgs?ref=feature/CRQ-016-nixify`,
as per the project's established Nix flake configuration.
This addresses the issue of using an incorrect `nixpkgs` source.
