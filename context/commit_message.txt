feat: Add --dry-run option to run_workflow.sh

Introduces a new `--dry-run` argument to `run_workflow.sh`. When this option is provided, the script will:
- Print the git status before attempting to commit.
- Log the commands that would be executed for committing changes and running Nix flake tests, without actually performing these actions.

This enhancement allows users to preview the workflow's actions and verify the state of the repository before making any permanent changes.
