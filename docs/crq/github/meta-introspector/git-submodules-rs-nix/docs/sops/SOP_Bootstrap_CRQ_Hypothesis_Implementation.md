# SOP: Implementing the Bootstrap CRQ Hypothesis

## Objective

To provide practical guidelines for implementing the "Bootstrap CRQ Hypothesis" (`CRQ-022`), ensuring that the entire system's construction and evolution are explicitly driven and documented by a finite set of Change Request Quality (CRQ) documents.

## Principles of Implementation

### 1. Every Change is a CRQ

*   **Granularity:** Break down all development tasks, no matter how small, into distinct CRQs. This includes bug fixes, new features, refactoring, documentation updates, and even infrastructure changes.
*   **CRQ Definition:** Each CRQ must clearly define its objective, scope, expected outcome, justification, and dependencies. It should be a self-contained unit of work.

### 2. CRQ-Driven Branching

*   **One-to-One Mapping:** Adhere strictly to the one-to-one mapping of CRQ to Git branch to Pull Request (`CRQ-019`). Every CRQ gets its own dedicated branch.
*   **Branch Naming:** Use a consistent branch naming convention that clearly links the branch to its associated CRQ (e.g., `feature/CRQ-XXX-short-description`, `bugfix/CRQ-YYY-issue-fix`).

### 3. Incremental System Construction

*   **Atomic Merges:** Each merged Pull Request (representing a completed CRQ) should incrementally build or refine the system. The system's state should always be valid and functional after each merge.
*   **Dependency Management:** Clearly define and manage dependencies between CRQs. A CRQ should only be started if its prerequisite CRQs are completed or are being worked on in parallel with a clear understanding of their integration points.

### 4. Living Documentation

*   **CRQ as Record:** The collection of all CRQs serves as the living, auditable documentation of the system's bootstrap and evolution. Each CRQ is a historical record of a specific change.
*   **Automated Documentation:** Explore tools and processes to automatically generate documentation or insights from the CRQ history.

### 5. 100% Readiness for Merge

*   **Definition of Done:** A CRQ-branch is only ready for merge when its encapsulated change is 100% complete, thoroughly tested (unit, integration, acceptance), documented, and reviewed. No partial merges.
*   **Quality Gates:** Implement automated quality gates (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, linting, static analysis) to enforce readiness criteria before a PR can be merged.

## Benefits

*   **Full Traceability:** Every part of the system is traceable back to its originating requirement.
*   **Enhanced Modularity:** Promotes a modular architecture by enforcing single-purpose changes.
*   **Reduced Risk:** Incremental construction and strict readiness criteria reduce the risk of introducing bugs.
*   **Improved Collaboration:** Clear CRQ definitions and branch isolation facilitate parallel development.
*   **AI-Ready System:** Creates a structured, machine-readable history of the system's development, enabling advanced AI analysis and assistance.

## Notes

*   This SOP requires discipline and commitment from all team members.
*   Automation tools (e.g., for branch creation, PR management, testing) are crucial for efficient implementation.
