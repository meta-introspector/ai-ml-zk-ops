# CRQ-016-Integrate_submod_to_Lattice.md

## Change Request: Integrate `submod` into Lattice System

### Objective

To integrate the `submod` submodule into the project's conceptual lattice system, enabling its contents and structure to be analyzed and classified within the broader project context.

### Description

This CRQ focuses on making the `submod` submodule's data accessible and understandable by the lattice system. This involves:

1.  **Indexing Files:** Ensuring that all relevant files within `submod` are indexed by the `project_file_lattice_builder` (or a similar tool).
2.  **Extracting Metadata:** Identifying and extracting key metadata from the submodule, such as its purpose, primary language, and any specific configurations.
3.  **Lattice Classification:** Defining appropriate predicates and classification rules within the lattice system to accurately categorize the submodule's components.

### Expected Outcome

*   `submod` files and metadata are successfully incorporated into the lattice structure.
*   The lattice system can provide insights into the role and contents of `submod` within the overall project.
*   Enhanced understanding of inter-submodule relationships within the lattice.

### Justification/Benefit

*   **Comprehensive Project View:** Provides a holistic view of the project, including its submodule dependencies, within the lattice.
*   **Improved Analysis:** Enables the lattice system to perform more accurate analysis and categorization of project components.
*   **Automated Insights:** Facilitates automated generation of insights and reports based on the submodule's integration.

### Dependencies

*   `submod` submodule present and accessible.
*   `project_file_lattice_builder` (or equivalent) capable of processing submodule contents.
