## Change Request: crq 010 dynamic information flow
**Change Request (CRQ)**

**Title:** Dynamic Information Flow and Influence Modeling (Inspired by Navier-Stokes & Multivector Concepts)

**Description:**
This change requests the development of an advanced analytical framework and tooling to model the dynamic flow and influence of information, ideas, and tasks ("memes") within the project's strategic direction (the "eigenvector"). Drawing inspiration from complex systems like Navier-Stokes flow and multivector concepts, this initiative aims to understand how various project elements propagate, interact, and transform across different dimensions (technical, business, social, historical). The goal is to move beyond static dependency mapping to a dynamic understanding of project momentum, identifying key influencers, bottlenecks, and emergent properties in the flow of work and knowledge.

**Justification/Business Value:**
*   **Predictive Analytics**: Potentially enables prediction of project trajectory, identifying areas of acceleration or stagnation.
*   **Optimized Communication & Collaboration**: By understanding information flow, communication channels can be optimized.
*   **Early Warning System**: Detects subtle shifts or resistances in project momentum.
*   **Deeper Strategic Insights**: Provides a nuanced understanding of how individual contributions coalesce into the overall strategic movement.

**Scope:**
*   **Included**:
    *   Conceptual modeling of "memes" as multi-dimensional entities.
    *   Development of metrics for measuring "flow" and "influence."
    *   Analysis of communication channels, decision points, and task dependencies as conduits for flow.
    *   Potential use of advanced data science techniques (e.g., network analysis, time-series analysis).
*   **Excluded**:
    *   Literal simulation of fluid dynamics or geometric algebra.
    *   Philosophical or abstract interpretations beyond their direct application to project dynamics.

**Impact:**
*   **Positive**: Leads to significantly deeper strategic insights and potentially transformative improvements in project management.
*   **Negative**: Requires extremely high intellectual and development effort, highly specialized expertise, and may have a long time-to-value.

**Dependencies:**
*   A fully functional Project Context Introspector (CRQ-003) as the primary data source.
*   Expertise in complex systems modeling, data science, and potentially advanced mathematics.

**Effort/Timeline:**
*   **Estimated Effort**: Extremely High. This is a research-heavy, highly complex, and innovative task.
*   **Estimated Timeline**: Long-term, highly iterative. To be determined after a detailed conceptual design and feasibility study.

**Verification:**
*   The developed models accurately represent observed project dynamics.
*   Insights generated lead to actionable improvements in project flow and strategic alignment.
*   The framework is extensible and adaptable to evolving project needs.
