# CRQ-002: Submodule Report Function Development

## 1. Overview

This Change Request outlines the development of a new reporting function to analyze the output of the `submodule-collector` tool. The primary goal is to provide comprehensive insights into the project's Git submodule landscape, including success/failure rates, duplicate entries, and organizational patterns.

## 2. Motivation

The existing `submodule-collector` successfully identifies and lists Git submodules. However, a deeper analysis of its output is required to understand the overall health, structure, and potential issues within the extensive submodule ecosystem. This report function will facilitate better project management, dependency tracking, and identification of areas requiring attention.

## 3. Objectives

Upon completion, the submodule report function shall:

*   Read and parse the `submodule_report_recursive_resilient.json` file generated by the `submodule-collector`.
*   Provide a clear count of successfully processed repositories and submodules.
*   Provide a clear count and list of repositories/submodules that failed processing, along with their associated error messages.
*   Identify and report duplicate repository URLs or submodule paths.
*   Analyze repository URLs to extract and report on the most frequently occurring organizations.
*   Analyze submodule names and other relevant strings to identify most frequently mentioned terms or patterns.

## 4. Implementation Details

*   **Input:** `submodule_report_recursive_resilient.json`
*   **Output:** A human-readable summary of the analysis, potentially in a Markdown or plain text format, suitable for console output or further documentation.
*   **Technology:** The report function can be implemented as:
    *   A new Rust binary.
    *   A new subcommand within the existing `submodule-collector` Rust project.
    *   A Python script utilizing existing JSON parsing libraries.
    *   Direct parsing and reporting within the Gemini CLI agent for interactive analysis.
*   **Error Handling:** The report function should gracefully handle malformed or incomplete input JSON files.

## 5. Testing

*   **Unit Tests:** If implemented as a standalone binary or subcommand, unit tests should cover JSON parsing, data aggregation, and statistical calculations.
*   **Integration Tests:** Verify the report function's ability to correctly process a sample `submodule_report_recursive_resilient.json` file and produce accurate output.

## 6. Future Considerations

*   Integration of the report generation into CI/CD pipelines for automated health checks.
*   Visualization of submodule data (e.g., graphs of dependencies, treemaps of organizations).
*   Historical tracking of submodule counts and error rates over time.
