## K-Value Type Semantics: Expanding Predicate Granularity in the Lattice

This document conceptually defines the semantic interpretation of different `k`-value types within the Lattice Idea Framework, extending beyond simple boolean predicates and RDF-like triples. These `k`-value types, derived from the `zos` sequence of prime numbers, represent increasing levels of granularity and complexity in knowledge representation.

### 1. The `zos` Sequence as Granularity Spectrum

The `zos` sequence `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]` serves as the foundation for defining the `k` in `k`-value types. Each prime number in this sequence corresponds to a distinct layer in our multi-layered model, where the fundamental unit of that layer can take on `k` possible values.

### 2. Semantic Interpretation of K-Value Types

*   **`k = 2` (Bit / Boolean Predicate):**
    *   **Interpretation:** The most fundamental level. A binary predicate, representing a simple true/false, present/absent, or yes/no state. This is the core of Model 1, where a word's presence in a text is a bit.
    *   **Example:** `(word_present, 1)` or `(feature_enabled, 0)`.

*   **`k = 3` (Triple / Relational Statement):**
    *   **Interpretation:** Extends beyond binary to represent basic relational statements, similar to RDF (Resource Description Framework) triples. These capture subject-predicate-object relationships.
    *   **Structure:** `(Subject, Predicate, Object)` or `(Entity, Attribute, Value)`.
    *   **Example:** `(Rust, has_feature, Ownership)`, `(LLM, generates, Text)`, `(Compiler, targets, x86_64)`.

*   **`k = 5` (Quintuple / Contextualized Statement):**
    *   **Interpretation:** Introduces additional context or qualifiers to a relational statement. This allows for more nuanced and situation-dependent knowledge representation.
    *   **Structure:** `(Subject, Predicate, Object, Context, Confidence)` or `(Entity, Attribute, Value, Time, Location)`.
    *   **Example:** `(Rust, has_feature, Ownership, (version, 2021), (stability, stable))`, `(LLM, generates, Text, (topic, AI), (style, formal))`.

*   **`k = 7` (Septuple / Event or Process Description):**
    *   **Interpretation:** Captures more complex events, processes, or actions, including participants, roles, and temporal/causal relationships. Useful for describing dynamic aspects of code or system behavior.
    *   **Structure:** `(Agent, Action, Object, Instrument, Time, Location, Outcome)`.
    *   **Example:** `(Compiler, compiles, SourceCode, (tool, rustc), (timestamp, T1), (platform, Linux), (result, executable))`, `(LLM, refines, Query, (method, RAG), (iteration, 3), (source, database), (quality, improved))`.

*   **`k = 11, 13, 17, 19` (Higher-Order Tuples / Complex Models and Narratives):**
    *   **Interpretation:** As `k` increases, the tuples can represent increasingly complex models, narratives, or even entire conceptual frameworks. These higher-order tuples allow for the encoding of rich semantic information, including:
        *   **Multi-faceted relationships:** Capturing how multiple entities interact across various dimensions.
        *   **Algorithmic descriptions:** Representing the steps and conditions of complex algorithms.
        *   **Narrative structures:** Encoding the elements of a story or a sequence of events.
        *   **System architectures:** Describing the components, connections, and behaviors of large-scale systems.
    *   **Conceptual Example:** A 19-tuple might represent the entire conceptual model of a programming language, including its syntax, semantics, type system, memory model, concurrency primitives, community philosophy, and common usage patterns, all as a single, highly structured entity within the lattice.

This layered semantic interpretation allows the Lattice Idea Framework to represent knowledge at varying levels of detail and abstraction, from simple binary facts to complex, multi-dimensional conceptual models, all within a unified and enumerable structure.
