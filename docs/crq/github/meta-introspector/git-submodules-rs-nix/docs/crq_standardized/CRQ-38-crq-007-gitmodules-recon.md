## Change Request: crq 007 gitmodules recon
**Change Request (CRQ)**

**Title:** Git Submodules Reconciliation and Health Check

**Description:**
This change requests the development and implementation of a process and/or tool to perform a comprehensive reconciliation and health check of Git submodules within the project. The primary goal is to verify the consistency between the `.gitmodules` file definitions and the actual state of the submodules on the filesystem and in their remote repositories. This includes checking for submodule existence, accessibility, correct configuration, and identifying any discrepancies such as orphaned directories or misconfigured entries. A detailed report on the health and status of all submodules will be generated.

**Justification/Business Value:**
*   **Ensures Project Integrity**: Guarantees that the project's submodule dependencies are correctly configured and accessible, preventing build failures or runtime errors.
*   **Prevents Configuration Drift**: Identifies and flags inconsistencies between `.gitmodules` and the actual submodule states, helping to maintain a clean and accurate project setup.
*   **Improves Developer Experience**: Provides clear insights into submodule health, reducing time spent debugging submodule-related issues.
*   **Facilitates Maintenance**: Simplifies the process of managing a project with numerous submodules by offering a consolidated view of their status.

**Scope:**
*   **Included**:
    *   Parsing of the `.gitmodules` file to extract submodule definitions (path, URL, branch/commit).
    *   Verification of each submodule's remote accessibility (e.g., `git ls-remote`).
    *   Checking the local presence and correct configuration of submodule working directories.
    *   Identification of orphaned submodule directories (directories present on disk but not in `.gitmodules`).
    *   Generation of a comprehensive report detailing the status of each submodule (e.g., OK, Missing, Inconsistent, Orphaned, Inaccessible).
    *   Integration with existing tools like `submod` or `magoo` if they offer relevant functionalities, or development of a new dedicated tool.
*   **Excluded**:
    *   Automatic remediation or fixing of identified inconsistencies (focus is on reporting).
    *   Deep content analysis of submodules beyond basic Git metadata.

**Impact:**
*   **Positive**: Enhances the reliability and maintainability of submodule-dependent projects. Provides actionable insights for project health.
*   **Negative**: Requires development effort for the reconciliation process/tool. Running the check might involve network requests to remote repositories.

**Dependencies:**
*   Access to the project's Git repository and `.gitmodules` file.
*   Network access for remote repository checks.
*   Git client installed and accessible.

**Effort/Timeline:**
*   **Estimated Effort**: Medium. Involves parsing, Git commands, and report generation.
*   **Estimated Timeline**: To be determined after detailed design of the reconciliation logic and reporting format.

**Verification:**
*   The reconciliation process accurately identifies all inconsistencies and provides a clear, actionable report.
*   The report's findings align with manual verification of submodule states.
*   Regular execution of the reconciliation process helps maintain high submodule health.
