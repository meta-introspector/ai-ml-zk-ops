# CRQ-015-Integrate_naersk_to_Lattice.md

## Change Request: Integrate `naersk` into Lattice System

### Objective

To integrate the `naersk` submodule into the project's conceptual lattice system, enabling its contents and structure to be analyzed and classified within the broader project context.

### Description

This CRQ focuses on making the `naersk` submodule's data accessible and understandable by the lattice system. This involves:

1.  **Indexing Files:** Ensuring that all relevant files within `naersk` are indexed by the `project_file_lattice_builder` (or a similar tool).
2.  **Extracting Metadata:** Identifying and extracting key metadata from the submodule, such as its purpose (Nix-based Rust build system), and its role in the project's build process.
3.  **Lattice Classification:** Defining appropriate predicates and classification rules within the lattice system to accurately categorize the submodule's components, focusing on its build and dependency management aspects.

### Expected Outcome

*   `naersk` files and metadata are successfully incorporated into the lattice structure.
*   The lattice system can provide insights into the project's build system and Rust dependency management via Nix.
*   Enhanced understanding of the build process within the project's dependencies.

### Justification/Benefit

*   **Comprehensive Project View:** Provides a holistic view of the project, including its build system dependencies, within the lattice.
*   **Improved Analysis:** Enables the lattice system to perform more accurate analysis and categorization of build-related components.
*   **Automated Insights:** Facilitates automated generation of insights and reports based on `naersk`'s integration, especially for build optimization or dependency analysis.

### Dependencies

*   `naersk` submodule present and accessible.
*   `project_file_lattice_builder` (or equivalent) capable of processing Nix and Rust build configurations.
