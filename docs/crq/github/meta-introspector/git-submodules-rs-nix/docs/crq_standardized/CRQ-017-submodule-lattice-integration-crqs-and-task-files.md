## Change Request: Submodule Lattice Integration CRQs and Task Files

### Objective

To introduce a set of Change Request Quality (CRQ) documents and corresponding task files for each project submodule, outlining their integration into the conceptual lattice system. These documents will serve as a structured approach for AI agents to understand and process submodule data for lattice classification.

### Description

This CRQ covers the creation of:

1.  **Submodule Integration CRQs:** For each identified submodule (`git-submodule-tools`, `gitoxide`, `magoo`, `naersk`, `submod`), a dedicated CRQ has been created (CRQ-012 through CRQ-016). These CRQs define the objective, description, expected outcome, justification, and dependencies for integrating the respective submodule into the lattice system.

2.  **Submodule Lattice Integration Task Files:** Corresponding task files have been created in the `docs/tasks/` directory for each submodule. These files compile relevant knowledge for AI agents, including submodule details (name, path, purpose, key files) and specific data points for extraction and potential predicates for lattice classification. For submodules where purpose and key files were not immediately known (`magoo`, `submod`), placeholders have been used, indicating a task for the AI to determine this information.

These documents are designed to facilitate the automated analysis and classification of submodule content by AI agents, contributing to a more comprehensive and intelligent understanding of the entire project structure.

### Expected Outcome

*   Structured documentation (CRQs and task files) for each submodule's integration into the lattice system.
*   Clear guidance for AI agents on how to process and classify submodule data.
*   A foundation for enriching the project's lattice with detailed submodule information.

### Justification/Benefit

*   **Automated Analysis:** Enables AI agents to autonomously understand and integrate submodule data into the lattice.
*   **Improved Project Understanding:** Provides a more granular and comprehensive view of the project's structure, including its dependencies.
*   **Standardized Integration:** Establishes a consistent process for bringing new submodules into the lattice system.
*   **Knowledge Compilation:** Centralizes relevant information for AI processing, reducing ambiguity.

### Dependencies

*   Presence of the listed submodules.
*   AI agents capable of reading and interpreting CRQ and task file formats.
*   `project_file_lattice_builder` (or equivalent) capable of processing submodule contents and integrating with AI-derived predicates.
