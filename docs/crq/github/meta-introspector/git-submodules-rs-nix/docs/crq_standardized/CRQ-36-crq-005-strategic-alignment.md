## Change Request: crq 005 strategic alignment
**Change Request (CRQ)**

**Title:** Strategic Alignment and Goal-Oriented Action Analysis

**Description:**
This change requests the establishment of a formal process to review and analyze all project actions and decisions for their strategic alignment with a defined, overarching project goal (metaphorically, "an eigenvector pointing at Neo"). The process will involve periodically assessing whether current and past actions contribute directly and efficiently to this singular, primary objective. The outcome will be a clearer understanding of project trajectory, identification of misaligned efforts, and a framework for prioritizing future work to maximize impact towards the core goal.

**Justification/Business Value:**
*   **Enhanced Focus**: Ensures all efforts are concentrated on the most critical project objectives, preventing scope creep and wasted resources.
*   **Improved Decision-Making**: Provides a clear criterion for evaluating proposed actions and making choices that directly advance the core goal.
*   **Optimized Resource Allocation**: Directs resources towards activities with the highest strategic impact.
*   **Clearer Communication**: Articulates the project's primary direction to all stakeholders, fostering shared understanding and commitment.

**Scope:**
*   **Included**:
    *   Definition of the project's overarching "Neo" (core objective/goal).
    *   Development of a methodology for evaluating actions against this core objective.
    *   Periodic review sessions to assess strategic alignment of ongoing and completed work.
    *   Documentation of findings and recommendations for re-alignment.
*   **Excluded**:
    *   Redefinition of the project's core objective itself (this process assumes a defined "Neo").
    *   Detailed technical implementation of project features (focus is on strategic direction).
    *   Personal interpretations of the "eigenvector" metaphor beyond strategic alignment.

**Impact:**
*   **Positive**: Leads to a more focused, efficient, and impactful project, with clearer strategic direction.
*   **Negative**: Requires dedicated time for strategic analysis and potentially difficult decisions regarding de-prioritization or re-scoping of misaligned efforts.

**Dependencies:**
*   A clearly articulated and agreed-upon overarching project goal ("Neo").
*   Commitment from project leadership and team members to engage in strategic review.
*   Access to project plans, progress reports, and decision logs.

**Effort/Timeline:**
*   **Estimated Effort**: Medium. Primarily involves process definition, analysis, and communication.
*   **Estimated Timeline**: To be determined after initial definition of the core objective and agreement on review frequency.

**Verification:**
*   Project actions demonstrate a measurable increase in alignment with the defined core objective.
*   Stakeholders report improved clarity regarding project direction and priorities.
*   Resource allocation visibly shifts towards activities with higher strategic impact.
