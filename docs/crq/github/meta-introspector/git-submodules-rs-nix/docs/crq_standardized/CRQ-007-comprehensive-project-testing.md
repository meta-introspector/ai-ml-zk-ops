# CRQ-007-comprehensive-testing.md

## Change Request: Comprehensive Project Testing

### Objective

To ensure the overall functionality, stability, and reliability of all project components by executing a comprehensive suite of tests, thereby verifying that recent changes have not introduced regressions and that the system behaves as expected.

### Description

This task involves performing a thorough testing regimen across the entire project. This includes:

*   **Unit Tests:** Running all unit tests for individual code components (e.g., Rust crates).
*   **Integration Tests:** Executing tests that verify the interaction between different modules or services.
*   **Nix Flake Checks:** Running `nix flake check` to ensure the integrity and buildability of all defined flake outputs (packages, applications, devShells).
*   **End-to-End/System Tests (if applicable):** Verifying the complete workflow of key functionalities.

The testing process will involve identifying the appropriate commands for each type of test and executing them systematically. Test results will be collected and reviewed to identify any failures or unexpected behaviors.

### Expected Outcome

*   A clear report on the status of all project tests, indicating passes and failures.
*   Confirmation that recent changes have not introduced regressions.
*   Increased confidence in the stability and correctness of the project's codebase.

### Justification/Benefit

*   **Quality Assurance:** A fundamental step in ensuring the delivery of high-quality software.
*   **Regression Prevention:** Catches bugs early, preventing them from propagating to later stages of development or production.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** Reduces the risk of critical failures and unexpected behavior.
*   **Evidence-Based Decision Making:** Provides concrete data on the health of the codebase, supporting release decisions (aligned with GMP and ISO 9000 principles).
*   **Continuous Improvement:** Test results provide valuable feedback for refining development processes and code quality.

### Dependencies

*   All test suites (unit, integration, flake checks) must be properly configured and runnable.
*   A stable development environment (e.g., provided by Nix) to ensure consistent test execution.
