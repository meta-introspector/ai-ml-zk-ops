## Change Request: llm communication protocol
## LLM Communication Protocol: Audited, Controlled, Curried, and Continuable

This document outlines the conceptual design for a robust communication protocol enabling secure, auditable, and stateful interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs) within the Lattice Idea Framework. This protocol is a critical component of the "Grand Unified Search" architecture, facilitating advanced knowledge extraction and collaborative reasoning.

### 1. Audited and Controlled Communication

Given the sensitive nature of knowledge extraction and the potential for LLMs to generate unexpected or biased outputs, the communication system must be rigorously audited and controlled:

*   **Audit Trails:** Every interaction (query, context, response, and any subsequent actions) is logged with timestamps, user/system identifiers, and relevant lattice addresses. This creates a comprehensive, immutable audit trail for transparency and debugging.
*   **Access Control:** Fine-grained access control mechanisms ensure that only authorized components or users can initiate queries or access specific types of LLM responses. This prevents unauthorized data exposure or manipulation.
*   **Content Filtering & Sanitization:** Inputs to and outputs from the LLM are subject to filtering and sanitization to prevent prompt injection attacks, mitigate bias, and ensure adherence to ethical guidelines. This can involve pre- and post-processing steps guided by lattice-defined predicates.
*   **Resource Governance:** Control over LLM resource usage (e.g., rate limiting, token limits) to manage costs and prevent abuse.

### 2. Currying for Contextual Pre-filling

Currying, in this context, refers to the ability to pre-fill or partially apply context to LLM queries, creating specialized query functions. This enhances efficiency and precision by embedding relevant lattice-derived information directly into the query structure.

*   **Mechanism:** Instead of sending a full context with every query, the system can create a "curried query function" that already includes:
    *   The current lattice address of the analysis (e.g., `layer_k_2/instance_X`).
    *   A set of relevant predicates already extracted from the code being analyzed.
    *   Specific constraints or objectives derived from the structured testing framework.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Reduced Redundancy:** Avoids sending repetitive contextual information with each query.
    *   **Improved Focus:** Guides the LLM more precisely towards the desired knowledge, reducing irrelevant responses.
    *   **Enhanced Security:** Sensitive context can be pre-processed or tokenized before being curried into the query, reducing direct exposure.

### 3. Continuation for Stateful Interaction

Continuation enables the system to maintain a stateful dialogue or reasoning process with the LLM across multiple turns, allowing for complex, multi-step knowledge extraction. This goes beyond simple Q&A to facilitate iterative refinement and deeper understanding.

*   **Mechanism:** Each LLM response can include a "continuation token" or a set of "continuation instructions" that guide the next query. This allows the system to:
    *   **Follow Chains of Reasoning:** If an LLM provides a partial answer, the system can use the continuation to ask for elaboration or the next logical step.
    *   **Resolve Ambiguities:** If an LLM response is ambiguous, the system can use continuation to provide clarifying context or ask targeted follow-up questions.
    *   **Iterative Refinement:** The system can iteratively refine its understanding of a complex concept by repeatedly querying the LLM, each time building on the previous response and guiding the LLM towards a fixed point of knowledge.
*   **Lattice Integration:** The state of the conversation and the progression of reasoning can be mapped onto the lattice. Each turn in the dialogue could correspond to a traversal path or a new node in the lattice, providing an auditable and analyzable record of the knowledge extraction process.

This protocol transforms LLM interaction from a series of isolated requests into a structured, intelligent dialogue, enabling the framework to extract and synthesize knowledge with unprecedented depth and control.
