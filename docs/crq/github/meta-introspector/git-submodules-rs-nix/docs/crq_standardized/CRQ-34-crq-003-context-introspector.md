## Change Request: crq 003 context introspector
**Change Request (CRQ)**

**Title:** Develop a Project Context Introspector

**Description:**
This change requests the development of a "Context Introspector" tool or system. The primary goal of this introspector is to analyze and present a comprehensive understanding of the project's current state and historical context. This includes, but is not limited to, file system structure, Git history, configuration files, dependencies, and the evolution of various components. The introspector should provide insights into how different parts of the project relate to each other and how they have changed over time.

**Justification/Business Value:**
*   **Enhanced Project Understanding**: Provides developers and new team members with a holistic view of the project, reducing the learning curve.
*   **Improved Debugging and Troubleshooting**: By visualizing relationships and historical changes, it can aid in identifying root causes of issues.
*   **Facilitates Refactoring and Design Decisions**: A clear understanding of context helps in making informed decisions about code modifications and architectural changes.
*   **Knowledge Discovery**: Can uncover implicit relationships and undocumented dependencies within the codebase.

**Scope:**
*   **Included**:
    *   Analysis of project files (e.g., `Cargo.toml`, `flake.nix`, `.gitmodules`, SOPs, CRQs).
    *   Parsing of Git history to extract relevant contextual information (e.g., commit messages, file changes, author information).
    *   Identification of dependencies and relationships between project components (e.g., submodules, Nix packages).
    *   Development of a mechanism to present this context (e.g., a report, a navigable data structure, a visualization).
*   **Excluded**:
    *   Real-time monitoring of project changes.
    *   Predictive analysis or AI-driven insights beyond presenting existing context.
    *   Integration with external systems (e.g., issue trackers, CI/CD dashboards) unless explicitly scoped later.

**Impact:**
*   **Positive**: Significantly improves developer productivity and project maintainability.
*   **Negative**: Requires substantial research and development effort due to the abstract nature of "context" and the complexity of parsing and presenting diverse data sources.

**Dependencies:**
*   Access to all project files and Git history.
*   Expertise in data parsing, graph theory (for relationships), and potentially visualization techniques.
*   Clear definition of what constitutes "context" and "insights" for this project.

**Effort/Timeline:**
*   **Estimated Effort**: Very High. This is a research and development heavy task with a high degree of uncertainty.
*   **Estimated Timeline**: To be determined after a detailed conceptual design and feasibility study.

**Verification:**
*   The Context Introspector successfully processes the project's data.
*   The presented context is accurate, comprehensive, and provides valuable insights to project stakeholders.
*   User feedback confirms the utility and usability of the introspector.
