## Change Request: crq 004 formalize interaction procedure
**Change Request (CRQ)**

**Title:** Formalize and Optimize Interaction Procedure

**Description:**
This change requests a comprehensive review, reflection, and formalization of the current interaction procedure between the user and the AI agent. The goal is to analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of the steps involved in understanding requests, planning, implementing solutions, verifying outcomes, and documenting processes. Based on this reflection, the procedure will be formalized into a clear, actionable guideline or SOP, aiming to optimize future interactions for clarity, speed, and accuracy.

**Justification/Business Value:**
*   **Process Improvement**: Identifies bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and areas for enhancement in the current interaction workflow.
*   **Increased Efficiency**: A formalized and optimized procedure leads to faster and more accurate task completion.
*   **Enhanced Clarity**: Provides a clear framework for future interactions, reducing ambiguity and improving communication.
*   **Reproducible Interactions**: Formalizing the procedure makes the interaction process itself more consistent and reproducible.
*   **Continuous Learning**: Establishes a mechanism for ongoing self-reflection and improvement of the AI agent's operational methodology.

**Scope:**
*   **Included**:
    *   Review of past interaction logs and completed tasks.
    *   Analysis of decision-making processes, tool usage, and communication patterns.
    *   Identification of successful strategies and areas requiring improvement.
    *   Drafting of a formal SOP or guideline for the AI agent's interaction procedure.
    *   Incorporation of best practices for clarity, conciseness, and proactiveness.
*   **Excluded**:
    *   Changes to the AI agent's core capabilities or underlying models.
    *   Automated execution of the formalized procedure (the procedure itself is the output).

**Impact:**
*   **Positive**: Leads to more streamlined, effective, and user-friendly interactions.
*   **Negative**: Requires dedicated time for self-analysis and documentation, potentially diverting resources from direct task execution in the short term.

**Dependencies:**
*   Access to complete interaction history and task outputs.
*   Ability for the AI agent to perform self-reflection and meta-analysis.
*   Clear criteria for evaluating interaction effectiveness.

**Effort/Timeline:**
*   **Estimated Effort**: Medium to High. Requires careful analysis and structured documentation.
*   **Estimated Timeline**: To be determined after an initial review of the interaction history and definition of key evaluation metrics.

**Verification:**
*   The formalized procedure is clear, comprehensive, and easy to understand.
*   Future interactions demonstrate improved efficiency, clarity, and user satisfaction as a result of applying the new procedure.
*   Feedback from users confirms the positive impact of the optimized interaction process.
