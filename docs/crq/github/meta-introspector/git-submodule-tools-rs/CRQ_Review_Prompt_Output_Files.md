# Change ReQuest: Review of Prompt Output Files

## Date: 2025-09-16

## Description:
This CRQ documents the review of `prompts/task_*.md.out*` files as per the task instructions.

## Outcome:
A search for files matching the pattern `prompts/task_*.md.out*` within the project directory `/data/data/com.termux.nix/files/home/pick-up-nix2/source/github/meta-introspector/git-submodule-tools-rs/` was performed.

Only one file, `prompts/task_crq.md.out1.md`, was identified. Upon inspection, this file was found to be empty. Furthermore, the content that was expected to be in `prompts/task_crq.md.out1.md` was already present in the base file `prompts/task_crq.md`.

Therefore, no new content was found that needed to be folded back into the base `task_*.md` files, and no modifications to existing `task_*.md` files were required.

## Verification:
The `glob` command was used to confirm the absence of other `prompts/task_*.md.out*` files.
