# CRQ: Branch Management Tool (ClearCase-like)

## Description

This CRQ defines the need for a new tool to streamline branch management within the Git repository, drawing inspiration from ClearCase's capabilities. The goal is to provide a more structured and automated approach to creating, updating, and committing changes to branches, especially in a complex, multi-repository environment.

## Key Requirements

*   **Branch Creation:**
    *   Automated creation of new branches based on predefined naming conventions (e.g., `feature/CRQ-XYZ`, `bugfix/CRQ-ABC`).
    *   Option to create branches from a specific commit, tag, or existing branch.
    *   Integration with the CRQ system to link branches directly to CRQs.
*   **Branch Updates:**
    *   Automated merging/rebasing of changes from a parent branch (e.g., `main`, `develop`) into the current branch.
    *   Option to automatically resolve simple conflicts or flag complex conflicts for manual intervention.
*   **Commit Management:**
    *   Structured commit message generation, potentially pre-filling with CRQ information.
    *   Ability to commit changes across multiple related repositories (submodules) as part of a single branch operation.
*   **Synchronization:** Ensure that all related repositories (superproject and submodules) are synchronized after branch operations (creation, update, commit).
*   **CRQ Integration:**
    *   Link branch operations directly to CRQ IDs.
    *   Potentially update CRQ status based on branch actions (e.g., "Branch Created", "Changes Committed").

## Rationale

Manual branch management in a large, complex Git repository with numerous submodules can be error-prone and time-consuming. This tool aims to:

*   Enforce consistent branching strategies and naming conventions.
*   Automate routine merging/rebasing tasks.
*   Improve traceability by linking code changes directly to CRQs.
*   Reduce the overhead of managing multiple repositories in sync during development.

## Out of Scope (for initial implementation)

*   Full-fledged GUI for branch visualization.
*   Complex merge conflict resolution strategies beyond basic auto-merging.
*   Integration with external CI/CD pipelines (though it should be designed to be compatible).
*   Advanced access control or permissions management on branches.

## Dependencies

*   Existing Git infrastructure.
*   The `submodule_manager` tool (for managing changes across submodules).
*   A defined CRQ system (conceptual or actual).
