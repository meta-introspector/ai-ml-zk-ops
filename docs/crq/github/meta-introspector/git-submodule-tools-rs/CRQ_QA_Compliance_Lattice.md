# CRQ: QA Compliance Lattice and OODA Integration

**Objective:** To establish a robust framework for ensuring project compliance with Quality Assurance (QA) standards by:
1.  Compiling the existing QA structure into a formalized "lattice of concepts."
2.  Developing a mechanism to "multiply" all project ideas (e.g., tasks, features, code components, meta-memes) by this QA concept lattice, thereby generating a "compliance lattice" that quantifies or qualifies their adherence to QA principles.
3.  Integrating the resulting compliance lattice into the Observe, Orient, Decide, Act (OODA) loop for informed prioritization and execution of project activities.

**Description:**

This Change Request aims to elevate our project's quality assurance from a set of procedures to an integrated, measurable, and actionable framework. The "QA concept lattice" will serve as a structured representation of all critical QA principles, methodologies, and criteria relevant to our development process. By "multiplying" project ideas against this lattice, we will create a "compliance lattice" â€“ a dynamic assessment of each idea's alignment with our quality standards. This compliance data will then be fed directly into our OODA loop, enabling us to:

*   **Observe:** Continuously monitor the compliance status of all ideas.
*   **Orient:** Understand the implications of compliance (or non-compliance) for project health and strategic goals.
*   **Decide:** Make data-driven decisions on which ideas to prioritize, refactor, or defer based on their compliance profile.
*   **Act:** Execute tasks with a clear understanding of their QA implications, ensuring that quality is built-in from inception.

This CRQ will involve:
*   Formalizing the QA concept lattice (as initiated in `docs/qa/qa_concept_lattice.md`).
*   Identifying and defining the representation of "ideas" within the project for compliance assessment.
*   Developing or extending tools (e.g., `poem_analyzer`, new Rust crates) capable of performing the "multiplication" to generate the compliance lattice.
*   Defining the metrics or qualitative assessments used within the compliance lattice.
*   Outlining the integration points and decision-making protocols within the OODA loop.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   A formalized QA concept lattice document (`docs/qa/qa_concept_lattice.md` is updated or finalized).
*   A clear definition of how "ideas" are represented for compliance assessment.
*   A fully implemented and functional mechanism (tool/script) capable of automatically generating a compliance lattice for a given set of ideas, demonstrating the "multiplication" process.
*   The compliance lattice provides actionable insights into the QA adherence of ideas.
*   Documentation outlining the integration of the compliance lattice into the OODA loop for prioritization and execution.
*   This CRQ is committed to the repository.
