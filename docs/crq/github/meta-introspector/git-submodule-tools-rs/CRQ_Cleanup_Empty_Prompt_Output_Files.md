# CRQ: Cleanup Empty Prompt Output Files

## Date: 2025-09-16

## Description:
This Change Request documents the cleanup of empty prompt output files generated during development. Specifically, the file `prompts/task_cargo.md.out1.md.out1.md` was found to be empty and was subsequently deleted.

## Rationale:
Empty output files do not contribute to the project's content and can clutter the repository. Their removal helps maintain a clean and organized project structure.

## Actions Taken:
- Identified `prompts/task_cargo.md.out1.md.out1.md` as an empty output file.
- Deleted the file using `rm`.

## Verification:
- Confirmed the file no longer exists in the file system.
- `git status` will reflect the deletion.

## Impact:
- No functional impact, as the deleted file was empty.
- Improves repository cleanliness.
