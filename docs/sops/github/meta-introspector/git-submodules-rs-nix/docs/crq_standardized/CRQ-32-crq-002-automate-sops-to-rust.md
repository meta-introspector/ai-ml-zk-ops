## Change Request: crq 002 automate sops to rust
**Change Request (CRQ)**

**Title:** Automate SOP Steps into Rust Programs using Git Submodules

**Description:**
This change requests the development of Rust programs that automate the operational steps detailed in all existing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). These programs will leverage the functionalities provided by the project's Git submodules, specifically `gitoxide`, `submod`, and `magoo`, to perform tasks such as Git repository management, submodule operations, and potentially other project setup steps. The goal is to create executable Rust tools that encapsulate and automate the documented procedures.

**Justification/Business Value:**
*   **Increased Automation**: Reduces manual effort and potential for human error in executing documented operational steps.
*   **Improved Consistency**: Ensures that procedures are executed uniformly every time, leading to more consistent project states.
*   **Enhanced Reproducibility**: Automating steps contributes to a more reproducible development and deployment pipeline.
*   **Code as Documentation**: The Rust programs themselves serve as living documentation of the operational steps, complementing the written SOPs.
*   **Leverage Project Submodules**: Fully utilizes the capabilities of the `gitoxide`, `submod`, and `magoo` submodules, demonstrating their practical application.

**Scope:**
*   **Included**:
    *   Analysis and interpretation of all operational steps described in existing SOP documents (`docs/sops/` and top-level SOPs).
    *   Design and implementation of Rust programs to automate these steps.
    *   Integration of `gitoxide`, `submod`, and `magoo` APIs into the Rust programs where applicable.
    *   Creation of necessary build configurations (e.g., `Cargo.toml`, `flake.nix` updates) for the new Rust programs.
*   **Excluded**:
    *   Automation of steps that are inherently manual or require human decision-making beyond simple input.
    *   Development of a full-fledged CLI framework unless necessary for specific SOPs.
    *   Refactoring of existing submodules.

**Impact:**
*   **Positive**: Significantly enhances project automation, consistency, and reproducibility. Provides concrete examples of submodule usage.
*   **Negative**: Requires substantial development effort in Rust programming and deep understanding of submodule APIs. Potential for bugs in automated scripts if SOP interpretation is incorrect.

**Dependencies:**
*   All existing SOP documents must be finalized and accurate.
*   Familiarity with Rust programming language and its ecosystem.
*   In-depth knowledge of `gitoxide`, `submod`, and `magoo` APIs.
*   Nix environment for building and testing the Rust programs.

**Effort/Timeline:**
*   **Estimated Effort**: Very High. This task involves complex software development, requiring careful design, implementation, and rigorous testing.
*   **Estimated Timeline**: To be determined after a detailed analysis of all SOPs and a design phase for the automation architecture.

**Verification:**
*   Successful execution of the generated Rust programs, demonstrating correct automation of SOP steps.
*   Verification that the automated outcomes match the expected results described in the SOPs.
*   Code review of the Rust programs for quality, maintainability, and correct submodule usage.
