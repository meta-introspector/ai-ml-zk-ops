## Change Request: Formal QA Procedures and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) Development

### Objective

To establish and document formal Quality Assurance (QA) procedures and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for critical project processes, ensuring adherence to ITIL, Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and ISO 9000 quality management principles. This will enhance process control, reproducibility, traceability, and overall project quality.

### Description

This CRQ outlines the framework for developing formal QA procedures and SOPs. **Crucially, the specific processes for which these documents are to be developed must be defined and agreed upon.** Once the scope is defined, the task will involve:

*   **Process Identification & Mapping:** Collaborating to identify and map out the steps, inputs, outputs, roles, and responsibilities for each selected process.
*   **SOP Drafting:** Writing detailed SOPs for each process, incorporating elements of:
    *   **ITIL:** Process flow, roles, responsibilities, interfaces with other processes (e.g., change management, release management).
    *   **GMP:** Emphasis on validation, verification, traceability, controlled environments, and documentation throughout the process lifecycle.
    *   **ISO 9000:** Document control, clear objectives, performance indicators, and mechanisms for continuous improvement.
*   **QA Procedure Development:** Creating QA procedures that define quality metrics, acceptance criteria, testing strategies (e.g., unit, integration, system, acceptance testing), and validation protocols relevant to the process outputs.
*   **Documentation Control:** Ensuring all developed documents are version-controlled, accessible, and subject to review and approval processes.

### Expected Outcome

*   A set of formally documented QA procedures and SOPs for the agreed-upon critical project processes.
*   These documents will serve as authoritative guides for executing processes consistently and with high quality.

### Justification/Benefit

*   **Enhanced Quality & Reproducibility:** Ensures consistent execution of processes, leading to higher quality and reproducible outcomes.
*   **Compliance & Auditability:** Provides clear documentation for internal and external audits, demonstrating adherence to ITIL, GMP, and ISO 9000 principles.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** Reduces errors and inconsistencies by standardizing operations.
*   **Improved Efficiency:** Streamlines processes and reduces reliance on individual knowledge.
*   **Knowledge Transfer:** Facilitates onboarding and ensures continuity of operations.

### Dependencies

*   **User Input:** Clear definition of the specific project processes for which QA procedures and SOPs are required.
*   Understanding of existing project workflows and tools.
