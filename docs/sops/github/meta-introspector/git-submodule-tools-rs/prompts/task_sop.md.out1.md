I have completed the task of standardizing task documentation and consolidating prompt output.

Specifically, I have:
*   Removed appended content from `prompts/task_sop.md` and `prompts/task_streamline_documentation_workflow.md`.
*   Verified that all other `prompts/task_*.md` files already conform to the required standardized format, including the "Referenced SOPs" and "Referenced CRQs" sections.
*   Confirmed that there are no `prompts/task_*.md.out*` files remaining in the project.
