# Standard Operating Procedure: Read Project Tasks

## Description
This SOP outlines the procedure for reading and reviewing project task files, which are located in the `~/pick-up-nix2/source/github/meta-introspector/git-submodule-tools-rs/prompts/` directory.

## Location of Task Files
All project task files are stored in:
`/data/data/com.termux.nix/files/home/pick-up-nix2/source/github/meta-introspector/git-submodule-tools-rs/prompts/`

## Procedure for Reading Tasks
1.  **List Task Files**: Use the `glob` tool with the pattern `task_*.md` within the specified directory to get a list of all task files.
2.  **Read Individual Task Files**: For each identified task file, use the `read_file` tool to read its content.
3.  **Review and Understand**: Carefully review the description, origin, and next steps outlined in each task file to understand its purpose and requirements.
4.  **Prioritize and Plan**: Based on the review, prioritize tasks and formulate a plan for their execution.

## Origin
User instruction to centralize task files and create a task for reading them.

## Next Steps
- Execute the procedure outlined above to list and read existing task files.
- Based on the content of the tasks, identify the next most critical action to take.
