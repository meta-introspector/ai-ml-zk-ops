# Standard Operating Procedure: Review and Integrate Task Changes

## Objective:
Review `git status` for changes related to `prompts/task_*.md.out*` files, and integrate these changes back into their respective base `task_*.md` files. Ensure that all modifications are properly contained and documented.

## Procedure:
1.  **Review `git status`**: Examine the output of `git status` to identify all `prompts/task_*.md.out*` files that have been modified or created.
2.  **Analyze `out*` Files**: For each identified `out*` file, review its content to understand the changes or outputs generated.
3.  **Integrate Changes**: Carefully integrate the relevant content from the `out*` files back into their corresponding base `task_*.md` files. This may involve:
    *   Updating task descriptions.
    *   Adding new steps or procedures.
    *   Incorporating new findings or context.
4.  **Ensure Containment**: Verify that the integrated changes are logically contained within the base task file and do not introduce extraneous information.
5.  **Document Changes**: Ensure that all significant changes are documented, potentially by updating relevant CRQs or adding comments within the task file itself.
6.  **Clean Up `out*` Files**: After successful integration, consider deleting the `out*` files to maintain a clean project structure.
