# Standard Operating Procedure: Chunk Large Files by Keywords and File Endings

## Description
This SOP outlines the procedure to create a system to break down large text files (`~/nix2/file.txt` and `~/pick-up-nix2/file.txt`) into smaller, manageable chunks. The chunking mechanism should primarily utilize keywords and file endings, with provisions for other methods as needed. This task involves an iterative and recursive approach, starting with broad terms and then refining the chunking by identifying sub-terms within filtered content.

## Identified Top 10 Unique Terms (Overall):
1.  `vendor` (170587 occurrences)
2.  `nixpkgs` (83746 occurrences)
3.  `pkgs` (78858 occurrences)
4.  `external` (69350 occurrences)
5.  `rust` (63665 occurrences)
6.  `tests` (61317 occurrences)
7.  `nix` (48520 occurrences)
8.  `name` (43001 occurrences)
9.  `rs` (42984 occurrences)
10. `by` (42884 occurrences)

## Origin
User request and analysis of `~/nix2/file.txt` and `~/pick-up-nix2/file.txt`.

## Next Steps
- **Define Chunking Logic**: Develop a clear strategy for how chunks will be defined, considering both initial broad chunking and recursive refinement based on sub-terms.
- **Implement Initial Keyword-Based Chunking**: Write scripts or code to process the large files and create initial chunks based on the overall top 10 keywords.
- **Implement Recursive Keyword-Based Chunking**: For specific chunks (e.g., those identified by 'vendor'), further process them to identify and utilize sub-terms (like the top 10 terms filtered by 'vendor') for finer-grained chunking.
- **Implement File Ending-Based Chunking**: Explore methods to chunk based on patterns resembling file endings within the text (if applicable and meaningful).
- **Consider Other Chunking Methods**: Investigate and implement other chunking strategies (e.g., fixed-size chunks, context-aware chunking) as deemed necessary.
- **Output Management**: Define a hierarchical naming convention and storage location for the generated chunks, reflecting the recursive nature of the chunking.
- **Verification**: Implement a method to verify that the chunking process is accurate and complete at each level of recursion.
