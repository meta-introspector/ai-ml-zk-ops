# Standard Operating Procedure: Standardize Task Documentation with SOPs and CRQs

## Objective:
Review existing tasks, develop corresponding Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Change Requests (CRQs), and standardize their structure and content. The goal is to create a canonical and consistent documentation framework for all project tasks.

## Key Actions:

1.  **Task Review:** Systematically review each existing task document.
2.  **SOP and CRQ Generation:** For each task, create relevant SOPs and CRQs.
3.  **Standardization:** Standardize the format and content of all SOPs and CRQs.
4.  **Task Prelude Development:** Develop a standard "prelude" section for all tasks that references necessary CRQs and SOPs.
5.  **Redundancy Removal:** Eliminate redundant text and information across all documentation.
6.  **Structure Canonization:** Establish and enforce a canonical structure for all task-related documentation.
7.  **Refactoring:** Rewrite and refactor existing documentation to align with the new standards.

## Guiding Principles:

*   **Divide and Conquer:** Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
*   **Unite and Rule:** Integrate standardized components to form a cohesive and governed system.
