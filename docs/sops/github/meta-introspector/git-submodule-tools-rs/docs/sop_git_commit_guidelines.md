# Standard Operating Procedure: Git Commit Guidelines

## Best Practices for Committing Changes:

1.  **Avoid Large Changes:** Do not commit massive changes, such as rewriting or deleting all files in a single commit.
2.  **Move Large Rewrites:** If a significant rewrite is necessary, move the rewritten content into new files.
3.  **Prefer Additions Over Modifications:** When possible, add new functionality or files rather than modifying existing ones. Retain older versions if they are still relevant.
4.  **Document Each Change:** Provide clear and concise documentation and explanations for every change introduced in a commit.
5.  **Branch for Each Task:** Create a dedicated branch for each task to isolate changes and facilitate review.
6.  **Link Commits to Tasks:** Document all commits by linking them to their corresponding tasks.
