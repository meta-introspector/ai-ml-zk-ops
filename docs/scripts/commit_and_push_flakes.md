## `scripts/commit_and_push_flakes.sh` Documentation

This script automates the process of committing changes, tagging, and pushing to Git submodules, specifically focusing on `flake.nix` standardization. It can operate on a specified list of submodule paths or automatically discover them.

**Key Features:**
*   **Configuration**: Defines a `TAG_NAME` (defaulting to "alpha"), `CRQ_NUMBER` ("016"), and `COMMIT_DESCRIPTION` ("Standardize flake.nix from template").
*   **Submodule Path Handling**:
    *   If an argument is provided, it uses that as the list of submodule paths.
    *   Otherwise, it discovers submodules by parsing `flake.nix` for `github:meta-introspector` entries, assuming they are located under `vendor/nix/`.
*   **Commit Delegation**: It delegates the actual commit operation to `./scripts/commit_crq_submodule.sh`, passing the submodule path, CRQ number, and commit description.
*   **Tagging and Pushing**: After committing, for each submodule:
    *   It handles Git remotes, similar to `branch_and_push_all.sh`, ensuring the `origin` remote points to the `meta-introspector` organization and forking if necessary.
    *   Pushes the current `HEAD` to the `origin` remote.
    *   Creates or updates a Git tag (defaulting to "alpha") and force-pushes it to the `origin` remote.

**Usage**:
This script can be run with an optional argument specifying the submodule paths to process. If no argument is provided, it will automatically discover relevant submodules. It's designed to be run from the project root.
