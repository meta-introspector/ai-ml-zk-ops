## `scripts/fix_submodule.sh` Documentation

This script provides a streamlined way to "fix" a submodule by applying a Nixification process and then committing and pushing the changes. It acts as an orchestrator for other scripts.

**Key Features:**
*   **Usage**: Requires a single argument: `submodule_path`.
*   **Error Handling**: Checks if the `submodule_path` argument is provided.
*   **Configuration**: Sets a `CRQ_NUMBER` ("016") and `COMMIT_DESCRIPTION` ("Standardize flake.nix from template"), which are passed to subsequent scripts.
*   **Nixification**: Calls `./scripts/nixify.sh` with the provided `submodule_path` and the `--apply` flag, indicating that the Nixification process should be executed.
*   **Commit and Push**: Calls `./scripts/commit_and_push_flakes.sh` with the `submodule_path`, which handles committing the changes and pushing them to the remote repository, including tagging.

**Usage Example**:
`./scripts/fix_submodule.sh vendor/nix/my-submodule`
