# CRQ-XXX: Flake.lock Dependency Vendoring and Build Time Optimization

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Author:** Gemini
*   **Date:** 2025-09-21

## 1. Problem Statement

The current `flake.lock` contains references to external GitHub repositories, leading to potential build time inconsistencies, reliance on external network resources, and slower build times. Duplicate entries for certain inputs also contribute to inefficiency.

## 2. Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive strategy for vendoring all external `flake.lock` dependencies under the `meta-introspector` GitHub organization. This includes:

1.  **Forking all remaining external dependencies** to `meta-introspector`.
2.  **Updating `flake.nix` and `flake.lock`** to reference these internal forks.
3.  **Investigating and resolving duplicate input entries** in `flake.lock`.
4.  **Exploring and implementing binary caching solutions** (e.g., `cachix`) to further reduce build times.

## 3. Scope

This CRQ applies to all `flake.lock` files within the project and their corresponding `flake.nix` inputs.

## 4. Impact

Adopting this CRQ will lead to:

*   Reduced build times.
*   Improved build reproducibility.
*   Decreased reliance on external network resources.
*   Enhanced control over project dependencies.

## 5. Rollback Plan

This CRQ involves changes to dependency management. In case of issues, `flake.lock` can be reverted to a previous state, and `flake.nix` inputs can be reconfigured to point to original external repositories if necessary.
