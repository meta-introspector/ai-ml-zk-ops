# CRQ: Enhance Nix Flakes Integration for Submodules

## Request
This Change ReQuest aims to fully integrate all project submodules into Nix flakes. The objective is to achieve enhanced reproducibility and streamlined dependency management within the Nix ecosystem, building upon existing efforts in `submodule-flakes/` and `submodule-flakes-generated/`.

## Justification
Full Nix flake integration for submodules will:
- Significantly improve the reproducibility of the project's build environment.
- Simplify dependency management and updates for submodules.
- Align with the project's overall Nix-centric development strategy.

## Scope
- Comprehensive review of current Nix flake configurations for submodules.
- Identification of areas requiring improvement or new implementations.
- Development and deployment of a unified Nix flake strategy for all submodules.
- Creation of detailed documentation for the enhanced integration.
