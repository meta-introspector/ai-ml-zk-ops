# CRQ: Standardize Task Management Procedures

## Change Request:
This CRQ proposes the standardization of procedures for managing development tasks within the project. This includes defining a clear workflow for identifying, processing, and documenting completed tasks, as well as maintaining the project's `task.md` file.

## Justification:
Currently, task management is ad-hoc, leading to inconsistencies in tracking progress, documenting outcomes, and updating project status. A standardized approach will improve project visibility, facilitate knowledge transfer, and ensure accurate reporting of accomplishments.

## Scope:
- Definition of a clear task lifecycle (e.g., identified, in-progress, completed, deferred).
- Procedures for moving task-related files (e.g., `prompts/task_*.md`) to a designated 'completed' directory upon completion.
- Guidelines for processing task results, including verification and summarization.
- Procedures for updating the main `task.md` file to reflect completed tasks and their outcomes.
- Creation of an SOP to detail these procedures.

## Deliverables:
- `docs/crqs/CRQ_Standardize_Task_Management.md` (this document)
- `docs/sops/SOP_Task_Management_Workflow.md`

## Approvers:
- [Project Lead]
- [Relevant Stakeholders]

## Status:
Proposed
