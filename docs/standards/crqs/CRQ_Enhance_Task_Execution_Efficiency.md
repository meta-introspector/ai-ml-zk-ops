# CRQ: Enhance Task Execution Efficiency

## Change Request:
This CRQ proposes a series of enhancements to improve the efficiency and reliability of task execution within the `gemini-cli` workflow. The goal is to minimize errors, streamline agent responses, and optimize the use of available tools, thereby reducing the number of turns required to complete tasks and improving overall productivity.

## Justification:
Analysis of past `shell.log` entries reveals recurring patterns of inefficiency, including:
-   Redundant or generic agent responses that do not provide specific progress updates.
-   Frequent errors in tool usage, particularly with path handling and `replace` operations, leading to multiple correction attempts.
-   Challenges in ensuring correct execution environments for scripts (e.g., Python dependencies).
-   Potentially broad task definitions that could benefit from finer granularity.

Addressing these issues will lead to a more robust, predictable, and efficient task execution process.

## Scope:
-   Develop guidelines for more precise and informative agent responses.
-   Implement pre-validation steps for tool calls (e.g., verifying file paths, checking `old_string` existence before `replace`).
-   Establish best practices for managing execution environments and dependencies for scripts.
-   Provide recommendations for optimal task granularity.
-   Integrate automated verification steps into the task completion process.

## Deliverables:
-   `docs/crqs/CRQ_Enhance_Task_Execution_Efficiency.md` (this document)
-   `docs/sops/SOP_Efficient_Task_Execution.md`

## Approvers:
