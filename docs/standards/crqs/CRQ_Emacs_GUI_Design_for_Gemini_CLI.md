# CRQ: Emacs GUI Design for Gemini CLI Integration

## Change Request:
This CRQ proposes the design and eventual implementation of a graphical user interface (GUI) within Emacs for interacting with the `gemini-cli` tool. A GUI would enhance user experience, making the integration more intuitive and accessible, especially for users less familiar with Emacs Lisp commands.

## Justification:
While the current Emacs Lisp integration provides powerful functionality, it relies on command-line interaction and keybindings. A GUI would offer a visual representation of tasks, outputs, and configuration options, significantly improving ease of use and discoverability. This aligns with the goal of making the `gemini-cli` integration as user-friendly as possible.

## Scope:
- Design a conceptual GUI layout within Emacs, considering existing Emacs UI elements (e.g., buffers, frames, modes, widgets).
- Outline key GUI components: task list display, prompt input area, output display, configuration access.
- Describe the user flow for common operations (e.g., selecting a task, running Gemini CLI, viewing results).
- Consider integration with existing Emacs features like `completing-read` for task selection.

## Deliverables:
- `docs/crqs/CRQ_Emacs_GUI_Design_for_Gemini_CLI.md` (this document)
- `docs/designs/Emacs_Gemini_CLI_GUI_Design.md` (conceptual design document)

## Approvers:
