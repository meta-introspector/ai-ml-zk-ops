# CRQ: Refactor Nix Expression for Submodule Checkout

## Request
This Change ReQuest proposes to refactor the Nix expression for standalone Git submodule checkout, as exemplified in `reviewsubmodule.out1.md`. The primary goal is to enhance flexibility and configurability by making `submoduleUrl` and `submoduleRev` configurable function arguments and setting `submoduleSha256` to a placeholder. This CRQ addresses the challenges encountered in previous attempts to modify this expression and leverages the provided concrete example.

## Justification
Refactoring the Nix expression will:
- Improve the reusability and flexibility of the submodule checkout mechanism.
- Allow for easier testing and modification of submodule sources and revisions.
- Align with best practices for configurable Nix expressions.
- Provide a clear, reproducible example for future submodule integrations.

## Scope
- Analysis of the Nix expression provided in `reviewsubmodule.out1.md`.
- Modification of the expression to accept `submoduleUrl` and `submoduleRev` as function arguments.
- Replacement of the concrete `submoduleSha256` with a placeholder.
- Updating relevant examples and comments within the Nix expression.
- Verification of the refactored expression's functionality.

## Origin
`reviewsubmodule.out1.md.out`, `reviewsubmodule.out1.md`
