# CRQ-017: Nix-First Development and Immutable State Policy

## 1. Problem Statement

As the project grows in complexity and the number of tools and submodules increases, maintaining a consistent, reproducible, and stable development environment becomes challenging. Inconsistent toolchains, varying build environments, and mutable project states lead to "works on my machine" issues, build failures, and difficulties in collaboration and deployment.

## 2. Proposed Solution

Implement a "Nix-First" development policy coupled with an emphasis on immutable project states. This policy will ensure that all development, build, and testing processes are managed and executed within Nix environments, leveraging Nix's capabilities for reproducibility and immutability.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to:
*   All shell scripts within the project.
*   All development environments.
*   All build and test processes.
*   The definition and composition of development tools.

## 4. Technical Details

### 4.1. Nix-First Execution for Scripts

All shell scripts (`.sh` files) within the project will be designed to be executed within a Nix environment. This will typically involve:
*   Ensuring scripts are invoked via `nix develop --command <script_name>`.
*   Defining necessary dependencies (tools, libraries) in the `devShell` of relevant `flake.nix` files.

### 4.2. Composable Flake-Defined Tools

Each tool or logical component that requires a specific environment or build process will define its own `flake.nix` file. These individual flakes will be designed to be composable, allowing them to be integrated into larger development environments or build processes as needed. This promotes modularity and reusability.

### 4.3. Immutable Project State

The project will strive for an immutable state, meaning:
*   All dependencies (including Rust toolchains, system libraries, etc.) will be precisely pinned in `flake.lock` files.
*   Build outputs will be stored in the Nix store, ensuring that builds are reproducible and isolated from the host system.
*   Changes to the project state will primarily be managed through Git, with clear commit messages and CRQ associations.

### 4.4. Integration with LLMs (Future Work)

In future iterations, Large Language Models (LLMs) will be integrated into this Nix-first workflow to assist with:
*   Automated generation of Nix expressions.
*   Intelligent debugging of Nix build failures.
*   Policy enforcement and compliance checking.

## 5. Testing and Verification

*   All new scripts and tools will be tested within their defined Nix environments.
*   Build reproducibility will be regularly verified.
*   Compliance with the "Nix-First" policy will be part of code reviews.

## 6. Rollback Plan

In case of issues, the project can revert to previous Git commits, leveraging Git's version control capabilities to undo changes to the Nix configuration and project state.

## 7. CRQ Association

This CRQ (CRQ-017) defines the overarching policy for Nix-first development and immutable project states.
