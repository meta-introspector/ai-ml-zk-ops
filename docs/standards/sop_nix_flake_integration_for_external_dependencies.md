# SOP: Nix Flake Integration for External Dependencies

## Purpose
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides guidelines for integrating external dependencies, including Git submodules, into Nix flakes to ensure reproducibility and consistent dependency management across the project.

## Scope
This SOP applies to all external dependencies and Git submodules managed within the project's Nix flake system.

## Procedure
1.  **Identify External Dependency**: Determine if an external dependency (e.g., a Git submodule, a third-party library) needs to be integrated via Nix flakes.
2.  **Flake Input Definition**: Add the external dependency as an input in the project's `flake.nix` file, specifying its source (e.g., Git URL, local path) and revision.
3.  **Package Definition**: Define a Nix package or module for the external dependency within the `flake.nix` or a separate Nix file referenced by the flake.
4.  **Submodule Handling**: For Git submodules, ensure that the flake correctly fetches and pins the submodule's specific revision. Utilize tools like `nix-prefetch-git` or similar mechanisms to obtain the correct `sha256` hash.
5.  **Usage in Derivations**: Reference the flake-managed dependency in other Nix derivations or packages within the project.
6.  **Testing**: Verify that the integrated dependency builds and functions correctly within the Nix environment.
7.  **Documentation**: Document the flake integration details for each external dependency, including any specific build instructions or configurations.
