# SOP: Automated Submodule Update Process

## Purpose
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) describes the process for implementing and maintaining automated checks for Git submodule updates within the project's Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.

## Scope
This SOP applies to all Git submodules used in the project and the CI/CD infrastructure.

## Procedure
1.  **Tool Selection**: Identify and select appropriate tools or scripts for monitoring upstream submodule repositories for new commits.
2.  **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate the selected tools/scripts into the project's CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
3.  **Trigger Mechanism**: Configure the CI/CD pipeline to trigger submodule update checks on a regular schedule (e.g., daily) or upon specific events (e.g., new commits to the main branch).
4.  **Notification**: Set up notifications (e.g., email, Slack) to alert relevant teams or individuals when submodule updates are available or when integration issues arise.
5.  **Update Strategy**: Define a clear strategy for applying submodule updates, including testing procedures and rollback plans.
6.  **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of the automated update process, including configuration details, troubleshooting steps, and contact points.
