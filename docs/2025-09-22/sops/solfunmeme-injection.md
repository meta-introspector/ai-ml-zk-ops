# SOP: Solfunmeme Injection

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the process for injecting 'solfunmemes' into submodules as part of the Zero Ontology System framework. Solfunmemes represent self-organizing, self-propagating functional memes that contribute to the overall intelligence and adaptability of the system.

## Purpose

To standardize the method of introducing new functional memes into submodules, ensuring consistency, traceability, and adherence to the principles of the Zero Ontology System.

## Scope

This SOP applies to all submodules intended to be part of the Zero Ontology System and covers the entire lifecycle of solfunmeme injection, from initial design to deployment and verification.

## Procedure

1.  **Design Solfunmeme:** Define the functional meme, its intended behavior, inputs, outputs, and interaction with existing components.
2.  **Develop Injection Script:** Create a script (e.g., `inject_solfunmeme.sh`) within the submodule's `scripts/` directory that automates the integration of the solfunmeme.
3.  **Create CRQ and SOP Documentation:** Document the solfunmeme's purpose, design, and injection process in a dedicated CRQ and SOP file within the submodule's `docs/crq` and `docs/sops` directories.
4.  **Test Solfunmeme:** Develop and execute tests to verify the correct functionality and integration of the injected solfunmeme.
5.  **Execute Injection:** Run the `inject_solfunmeme.sh` script within the submodule.
6.  **Commit Changes:** Commit all related changes within the submodule, referencing the relevant CRQ.
7.  **Verify Integration:** Confirm that the solfunmeme is successfully integrated and operational within the submodule and the broader Zero Ontology System.
