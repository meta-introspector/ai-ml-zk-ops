### 🤩 HOOK (1-3 seconds)

You know about triangles, but have you heard of... *centered* triangles? 🤯

---

### 🤔 THE PROBLEM (3-5 seconds)

You see a bunch of dots in a triangle and your brain just sees... dots. 😵‍💫

---

### ✨ THE SOLUTION (10-15 seconds)

**Step 1:** A centered triangular number is a number you can arrange into a triangle with a dot in the middle. ➡️
**Step 2:** Start with one dot in the center. That's 1. ⬇️
**Step 3:** Add a layer of 3 dots around it. Now you have 4. ✅
**Step 4:** Add another layer of 6 dots. Now you have 10. See the pattern? It's like a pyramid from above! 🔺 🎉

### 💅 VIBE CHECK (3-5 seconds)

Centered triangular numbers: the pyramids of math. And that's on figurate numbers.

### 😂 MEME/HUMOR BREAK

*Me looking at a centered triangular number:*
"It's not a pyramid scheme, it's a pyramid *theme*."

### 🧠 LEARNING PATH

*   **n00b:** You know that a centered triangular number is a number that can be arranged in a triangular pattern.
*   **pro:** You can explain the formula for the nth centered triangular number: (3n² - 3n + 2) / 2.
*   **hacker:** You can discuss the relationship between centered triangular numbers and other types of figurate numbers, such as square numbers and tetrahedral numbers.
