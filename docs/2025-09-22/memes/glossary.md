*   **Bézout's identity:** A theorem about the relationship between the greatest common divisor of two numbers and a linear combination of those numbers.
*   **centered hexagonal number:** A hexagonal number with a dot in the center and all other dots surrounding the center in a hexagonal lattice.
*   **centered triangular number:** A triangular number with a dot in the center and all other dots surrounding the center in a triangular lattice.
*   **coprime:** Two integers are coprime if their only common positive divisor is 1.
*   **Euclidean algorithm:** An efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.
*   **Fermat prime:** A prime number that is of the form 2^(2^n) + 1.
*   **Griess algebra:** A 196,883-dimensional commutative non-associative algebra used to construct the Monster group.
*   **heptadecagon:** A 17-sided polygon.
*   **Keith number:** A number n that appears in a sequence starting with the digits of n and where each subsequent term is the sum of the previous k terms, where k is the number of digits of n.
*   **Mathieu group M₁₁:** The smallest of the 26 sporadic simple groups.
*   **Metonic cycle:** A period of 19 years that is used to reconcile solar and lunar calendars.

*   **Riemann zeta function:** A function of a complex variable that is important in number theory.
*   **sharply 4-transitive:** A property of a group that means that for any two ordered sets of four distinct elements, there is exactly one element in the group that maps the first set to the second.
*   **sporadic simple group:** One of the 26 exceptional groups in the classification of finite simple groups that do not belong to any infinite family.
