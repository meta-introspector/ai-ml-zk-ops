### 🤩 HOOK (1-3 seconds)

You think all prime numbers are the same? Meet the Fermat primes, the VIPs of the prime number world. 👑

---

### 🤔 THE PROBLEM (3-5 seconds)

You see `Fₙ = 2^(2ⁿ) + 1` and you just want to go to sleep. 😴

---

### ✨ THE SOLUTION (10-15 seconds)

**Step 1:** A Fermat prime is a special kind of prime number. ➡️
**Step 2:** The first few are 3, 5, 17, 257, and 65537. ⬇️
**Step 3:** These are the *only* known Fermat primes! We haven't found any others. ✅
**Step 4:** They're super important because they determine which regular polygons can be drawn with a compass and straightedge. 🤯 🎉

---

### 💅 VIBE CHECK (3-5 seconds)

Fermat primes: the secret to drawing perfect shapes. And that's on number theory.

### 🧠 LEARNING PATH

*   **n00b:** You know that a Fermat prime is a special type of prime number and that there are only five known.
*   **pro:** You can explain the formula for Fermat numbers and the Gauss-Wantzel theorem, which connects Fermat primes to the constructibility of regular polygons.
*   **hacker:** You can discuss the history of the search for Fermat primes, including Euler's factorization of F₅, and the challenges of primality testing for large Fermat numbers.
