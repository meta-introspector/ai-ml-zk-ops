### 🤩 HOOK (1-3 seconds)

You think you're good at puzzles? Try solving a Steiner system. 🤯

---

### 🤔 THE PROBLEM (3-5 seconds)

You hear "Steiner system" and you think it's a new brand of power tools. 🛠️ (It's not, but it's just as powerful).

---

### ✨ THE SOLUTION (10-15 seconds)

**Step 1:** A Steiner system is a set of points and a collection of subsets of those points, called blocks. ➡️
**Step 2:** The rule is that any `t` points must be in exactly one block. ⬇️
**Step 3:** For example, in a Steiner triple system S(2,3,n), any two points must be in exactly one block of three points. ✅
**Step 4:** The Mathieu groups are the symmetry groups of some very special Steiner systems. 🎉

### 💅 VIBE CHECK (3-5 seconds)

Steiner systems: the ultimate game of connect the dots. And that's on combinatorics.

### 🧠 LEARNING PATH

*   **n00b:** You know that a Steiner system is a set of points and blocks with a specific rule about how the points are arranged in the blocks.
*   **pro:** You can explain the parameters of a Steiner system (t, k, n) and you can give examples of different types of Steiner systems, such as Steiner triple systems.
*   **hacker:** You can discuss the existence conditions for Steiner systems, the relationship between Steiner systems and finite geometries, and the role of Steiner systems in the construction of the Mathieu groups.
