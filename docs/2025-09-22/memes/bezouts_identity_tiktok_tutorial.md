### 🤩 HOOK (1-3 seconds)

You and your friend have a weirdly specific amount of money. Can you combine it to make exactly $3? 🤨

---

### 🤔 THE PROBLEM (3-5 seconds)

You see `ax + by = gcd(a, b)` and your brain melts. 🫠 It looks like alphabet soup.

---

### ✨ THE SOLUTION (10-15 seconds)

**Step 1:** Let's say you have multiples of $15 and your friend has multiples of $69. ➡️
**Step 2:** The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 15 and 69 is 3. ⬇️
**Step 3:** Bézout's identity says you *can* combine some multiple of 15 and some multiple of 69 to get 3. ✅
**Step 4:** In this case, `15 * (-9) + 69 * 2 = 3`. So if you give away 9 of your $15 items and your friend gives you 2 of their $69 items, you end up with $3! 🤯 🎉
