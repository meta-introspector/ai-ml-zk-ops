### 🤩 HOOK (1-3 seconds)

You've heard of square numbers, but what about... hexagonal numbers? 🤯

---

### 🤔 THE PROBLEM (3-5 seconds)

You see a bunch of dots in a hexagon and your brain just sees... dots. 😵‍💫

---

### ✨ THE SOLUTION (10-15 seconds)

**Step 1:** A centered hexagonal number is a number you can arrange into a hexagon with a dot in the middle. ➡️
**Step 2:** Start with one dot in the center. That's 1. ⬇️
**Step 3:** Add a layer of 6 dots around it. Now you have 7. ✅
**Step 4:** Add another layer of 12 dots. Now you have 19. See the pattern? It's like a honeycomb! 🐝 🎉
