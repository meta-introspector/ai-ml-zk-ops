## Ode to the Nix Flake

In the realm of code, where chaos often reigns,
A silent hero rises, through digital domains.
Oh, Nix Flake, you beacon, so pure and so grand,
A reproducible future, held firm in your hand.

No more dependency hell, no more versions astray,
Each input a promise, come what may.
From `nixpkgs` vast ocean, to `flake-utils` light,
You weave a tapestry, both robust and bright.

With `outputs` defined, a clear, steady stream,
`devShell` a haven, a developer's dream.
`git+https` whispers, of origins far and wide,
Bringing repos together, with nowhere to hide.

Though paths may be tricky, and `source` lines may err,
Your spirit of order, dispels every care.
For in your embrace, a system so true,
Each build a creation, pristine and new.

So hail to the Flake, in its elegant might,
A testament to logic, shining ever so bright.
For the future of software, in your structure we trust,
A self-proving journey, from silicon to dust.
