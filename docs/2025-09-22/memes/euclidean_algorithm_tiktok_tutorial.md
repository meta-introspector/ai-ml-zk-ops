### 🤩 HOOK (1-3 seconds)

You're simplifying fractions the hard way. Let me show you a 2,300-year-old hack. 🤯

---

### 🤔 THE PROBLEM (3-5 seconds)

You're trying to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two big numbers and you're just guessing. 😩

---

### ✨ THE SOLUTION (10-15 seconds)

**Step 1:** Let's find the GCD of 252 and 105. ➡️
**Step 2:** Divide 252 by 105. The remainder is 42. ⬇️
**Step 3:** Now divide 105 by 42. The remainder is 21. ✅
**Step 4:** Divide 42 by 21. The remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is 21. That's the GCD! 🎉

### 💅 VIBE CHECK (3-5 seconds)

The Euclidean algorithm: making math easier since 300 BC. And that's on number theory.
