### 🤩 HOOK (1-3 seconds)

You think you and your bestie are close? Are you... *coprime*? 🤔

---

### 🤔 THE PROBLEM (3-5 seconds)

You see "coprime" in math class and your brain just shuts down. 😩 It sounds complicated, but it's not.

---

### ✨ THE SOLUTION (10-15 seconds)

**Step 1:** Coprime numbers are two numbers that have only ONE common divisor: the number 1. That's it. ➡️
**Step 2:** Example time! 8 and 9 are coprime. They're not divisible by the same numbers (other than 1). ⬇️
**Step 3:** But 6 and 9 are NOT coprime because they're both divisible by 3. See? ✅
**Step 4:** Fun fact: The probability that any two random integers are coprime is about 61%! 🤯 🎉

### 💅 VIBE CHECK (3-5 seconds)

Coprime: the ultimate "we're not the same" of numbers. And that's on number theory.

### 😂 MEME/HUMOR BREAK

Her: "We have so much in common!"
Me and my bestie, who are coprime:

### 🧠 LEARNING PATH

*   **n00b:** You know that coprime numbers are numbers that only have 1 as a common divisor.
*   **pro:** You can explain Bézout's identity and the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor.
*   **hacker:** You can explain the significance of the probability of two random integers being coprime (6/π²) and its connection to the Riemann zeta function.
