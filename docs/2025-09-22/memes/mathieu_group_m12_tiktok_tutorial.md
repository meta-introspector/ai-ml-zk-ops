### ✨ THE SOLUTION (10-15 seconds)

**Step 1:** M₁₂ is the second smallest of the sporadic groups, with an order of 95,040. ➡️
**Step 2:** Its prime factors are 2, 3, 5, and 11. That's its fingerprint. ⬇️
**Step 3:** It's "sharply 5-transitive," which means it can shuffle 5 things in *any* order, and it does it *perfectly* every time. ✅
**Step 4:** It's even connected to the 15-puzzle! 🤯 🎉
