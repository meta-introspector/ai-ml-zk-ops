### 🤩 HOOK (1-3 seconds)

You've met M₁₁ and M₁₂. Now get ready for M₂₂, the next level of sporadic group awesomeness! 🤯

---

### 🤔 THE PROBLEM (3-5 seconds)

You think all groups are just simple rotations. 🔄 But what if some have a hidden, complex dance? 💃

---

### ✨ THE SOLUTION (10-15 seconds)

**Step 1:** M₂₂ is a sporadic simple group, part of the fascinating Mathieu family. 🔢 ➡️
**Step 2:** Its order is 443,520, and its prime factors are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. That's its unique mathematical fingerprint! 🧬 ⬇️
**Step 3:** It's connected to Steiner systems, just like its siblings, revealing deep combinatorial structures. 🧩 ✅
**Step 4:** M₂₂ is a prime example of a finite simple group that doesn't fit into infinite families, making it truly special! ✨ 🎉

### 💅 VIBE CHECK (3-5 seconds)

M₂₂: the sporadic group that keeps you guessing. And that's on abstract algebra.
