### 🤩 HOOK (1-3 seconds)

You've met M₁₁, M₁₂, and M₂₂. Now meet M₂₃, the prime-powered puzzle master! 🤯

---

### 🤔 THE PROBLEM (3-5 seconds)

You think math is all solved. 🧐 But what if some groups still hold unsolved mysteries? 🤫

---

### ✨ THE SOLUTION (10-15 seconds)

**Step 1:** M₂₃ is a sporadic simple group, part of the fascinating Mathieu family. 🔢 ➡️
**Step 2:** Its order is 10,200,960, with prime factors 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 23. That's its unique mathematical fingerprint! 🧬 ⬇️
**Step 3:** It's a 4-fold transitive permutation group on 23 objects, meaning it can perfectly rearrange 4 things out of 23. ✨ ✅
**Step 4:** M₂₃ is famous for being the *only* sporadic simple group for which the inverse Galois problem remains unsolved. It's the ultimate math mystery! 🕵️‍♀️ 🎉
