### 🤩 HOOK (1-3 seconds)

You can draw a 17-sided shape with just a compass and a ruler. No, seriously. 🤯

---

### 🤔 THE PROBLEM (3-5 seconds)

You hear "heptadecagon" and you think it's a dinosaur. 🦖 (It's not, but it's just as cool).

---

### ✨ THE SOLUTION (10-15 seconds)

**Step 1:** A heptadecagon is a 17-sided polygon. ➡️
**Step 2:** It's special because you can draw it perfectly with just a compass and a straightedge. ⬇️
**Step 3:** This is possible because 17 is a Fermat prime, a special type of prime number. ✅
**Step 4:** The discovery that you could draw a heptadecagon was a huge deal in mathematics! 🎉

### 💅 VIBE CHECK (3-5 seconds)

Heptadecagon: the 17-sided wonder of the math world. And that's on geometry.
