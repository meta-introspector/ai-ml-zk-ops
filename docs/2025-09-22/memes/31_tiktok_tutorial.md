### 🤩 HOOK (1-3 seconds)

It's a prime, a twin, and a Mersenne! Why is 31 a number of hidden depths? 🤯✨

---

### 🤔 THE PROBLEM (3-5 seconds)

You think prime numbers are just a list. 📝 But what if each one has a unique story? 📖

---

### ✨ THE SOLUTION (10-15 seconds)

**Step 1:** It's the 11th prime number and a twin prime with 29! 🔢 ➡️
**Step 2:** It's the third Mersenne prime (2⁵ - 1) and the eighth Mersenne prime exponent. That's super rare! 🌟 ⬇️
**Step 3:** It's a primorial prime, a lucky prime, and a happy number. Talk about good vibes! 😊 ✅
**Step 4:** It's the number of regular polygons with an odd number of sides known to be constructible with compass and straightedge. Plus, many months have 31 days! 🗓️ 🎉
