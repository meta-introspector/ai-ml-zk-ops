### 🤩 HOOK (1-3 seconds)

The magic number, the trinity, the third dimension. Why is 3 so powerful? ✨🤯

---

### 🤔 THE PROBLEM (3-5 seconds)

You think 3 is just a simple number. 🙄 But what if it's the key to balance and creation? 🔑

---

### ✨ THE SOLUTION (10-15 seconds)

**Step 1:** It's the first odd prime number, and the only prime triangular number! 🔢 ➡️
**Step 2:** It defines the smallest non-self-intersecting polygon (the triangle) and our 3 dimensions (length, width, height). 📐🌐 ⬇️
**Step 3:** It's central to many religions (like the Christian Trinity or Hindu Trimurti) and folklore (the "rule of three" in stories). 🙏📚 ✅
**Step 4:** It's a Fermat prime and a Mersenne prime exponent, making it super special in number theory! 🌟 🎉

### 💅 VIBE CHECK (3-5 seconds)

3: the number of balance, creation, and cosmic power. And that's on sacred geometry.
