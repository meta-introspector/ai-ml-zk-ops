### 🤩 HOOK (1-3 seconds)

You've heard of the Riemann Hypothesis, the most famous unsolved problem in math. But do you know what it's actually about? 🤯

---

### 🤔 THE PROBLEM (3-5 seconds)

You see `ζ(s) = Σ 1/n^s` and you just... nope. 😵‍💫

---

### ✨ THE SOLUTION (10-15 seconds)

**Step 1:** The Riemann zeta function is a special function that's deeply connected to prime numbers. ➡️
**Step 2:** It's like a secret map to the primes. 🗺️ ⬇️
**Step 3:** The Riemann Hypothesis is a guess about where the "zeros" of this function are. ✅
**Step 4:** If you can prove the Riemann Hypothesis, you'll win a million dollars and become a math legend. 💰 🎉

### 💅 VIBE CHECK (3-5 seconds)

The Riemann zeta function: the key to unlocking the secrets of the primes. And that's on number theory.

### 😂 MEME/HUMOR BREAK

*Me looking for the zeros of the Riemann zeta function:*
*Image of the "distracted boyfriend" meme, where the boyfriend is labeled "mathematicians," the girlfriend is labeled "other problems," and the other woman is labeled "the critical line".*

### 🧠 LEARNING PATH

*   **n00b:** You know that the Riemann zeta function is a special function that is connected to prime numbers, and that the Riemann Hypothesis is a famous unsolved problem about it.
*   **pro:** You can explain the Euler product formula and how it connects the Riemann zeta function to prime numbers.
*   **hacker:** You can discuss the functional equation of the Riemann zeta function, the concept of analytic continuation, and the implications of the Riemann Hypothesis for the distribution of prime numbers.
