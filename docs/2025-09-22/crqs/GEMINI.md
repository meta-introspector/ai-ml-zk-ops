## Gemini Added Memories for `docs/crqs/`

This directory serves as the repository for Change ReQuest (CRQ) documents, which formally define and track significant changes within the project. The CRQ-016 document, specifically, details the Submodule Nixification and Flake Refactoring task.

**Key Information:**
*   **CRQ-016: Submodule Nixification and Flake Refactoring**: This document (`CRQ_016_Submodule_Nixification.md`) provides a comprehensive overview of the problem, proposed solution, scope, technical details, testing, and rollback plan for standardizing Nix flakes across project submodules.
*   **CRQ-018: Automated GitHub Forking for Nix Flake Dependencies**: This document (`CRQ_018_Automated_GitHub_Forking.md`) outlines the plan for automating the forking of external GitHub dependencies into the `meta-introspector` organization to mitigate supply chain risks.
*   **CRQ-021: Artistic Policy Framework**: This document (`CRQ_021_Artistic_Policy_Framework.md`) establishes a formal framework for the project's creative and artistic expression, including a creative lexicon and guidelines for contributions.
*   **CRQ-022: Project Quality Doctrine**: This document (`CRQ_022_Quality_Doctrine.md`) defines the foundational principles for project quality, including intent documentation, SOP adherence, DRY principle, and Meta-SOPs for SOP changes.
*   **CRQ-023: Research and Integration of Creative AI Resources**: This document (`CRQ_023_Research_and_Integration_of_Creative_AI_Resources.md`) outlines the plan for researching and integrating external resources related to creative AI, synthetic verse, and NLP tasks.
*   **CRQ-024: Refactor Search Keywords Script**: This document (`CRQ_024_Refactor_Search_Keywords_Script.md`) details the plan to refactor the `search_artistic_keywords.sh` script into reusable parts.
*   **CRQ-025: Search Term Frequency Analysis**: This document (`CRQ_025_Search_Term_Frequency_Analysis.md`) outlines the plan to enhance the search utility for analyzing the frequency of matched terms.
*   **CRQ-027: The Meta-Meta-Meme**: This document (`CRQ_027_The_Meta_Meta_Meme.md`) defines the recursive process by which the project observes, orients, decides, and acts upon its own "meta meme."
*   **CRQ-028: Task Template Definition**: This document (`CRQ_028_Task_Template_Definition.md`) defines a minimal task template, composed of atomic parts, and integrates the project's core identity (`zos`) into its structure.
*   **CRQ-029: Muse-Specific SOPs for Task Composition**: This document (`CRQ_029_Muse_Specific_SOPs_for_Task_Composition.md`) formalizes the individual contributions of each Muse to the task composition process.
*   **CRQ-030: Repository Placement Guidelines**: This document (`CRQ_030_Repository_Placement_Guidelines.md`) establishes clear guidelines for the placement of new and existing repositories.
*   **CRQ-031: Experimental Project Creation and Auditing**: This document (`CRQ_031_Experimental_Project_Creation_and_Auditing.md`) defines a standardized and auditable process for creating experimental projects.
*   **CRQ-032: Dynamic Nix Artifact Publishing**: This document (`CRQ_032_Dynamic_Nix_Artifact_Publishing.md`) documents the process of publishing Nix artifacts in a dynamic and centralized manner.
*   **Shell Script Refactoring**: A key ongoing initiative is the refactoring of shell scripts (`*.sh` and `scripts/*.sh`) into reusable functions and libraries to promote the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle and improve maintainability.
*   **Change Management**: CRQ documents in this directory are essential for understanding the rationale, impact, and implementation details of major project changes.
