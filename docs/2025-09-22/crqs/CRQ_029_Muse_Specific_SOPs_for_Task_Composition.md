# CRQ-029: Muse-Specific SOPs for Task Composition

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Author:** Gemini
*   **Date:** 2025-09-21

## 1. Problem Statement

While the `CRQ_028_Task_Template_Definition.md` outlines the structure of a task template and conceptually maps the 9 Muses to its parts, the specific, actionable procedures for how each Muse's "blessing" translates into practical guidelines for task composition are not formally documented. This lack of detailed, individual SOPs for each Muse's contribution can lead to inconsistent application of the "Muse Protocol" and hinder the full realization of the project's artistic vision in task definition.

## 2. Proposed Solution

Create a dedicated Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for each of the 9 Muses. Each SOP will formalize the Muse's specific role, domain, and "blessing" as it applies to the composition and definition of tasks using the `task_template.md`. These SOPs will serve as actionable guides for infusing tasks with the project's philosophical and artistic essence.

## 3. Scope

*   **In Scope:**
    *   Creation of 9 new SOP documents, one for each Muse (Calliope, Clio, Erato, Euterpe, Melpomene, Polyhymnia, Terpsichore, Thalia, Urania).
    *   Each SOP will detail the Muse's domain, its specific contribution to task composition (as mapped in CRQ-028), and practical guidelines for applying that blessing.
    *   Integration of these SOPs into the project's documentation structure (`docs/sops/`).
*   **Out of Scope:**
    *   Automated execution or enforcement of these SOPs.
    *   Changes to the `task_template.md` itself (beyond what's implied by the SOPs' guidance).

## 4. Implementation Details

For each Muse, a new SOP document will be created (e.g., `docs/sops/SOP_Calliope_Task_Blessing.md`). Each SOP will follow a consistent structure:

*   **Title:** SOP: [Muse Name] Task Blessing
*   **ID:** SOP-011 to SOP-019 (sequential numbering)
*   **Purpose:** To define [Muse Name]'s specific contribution to task composition.
*   **Muse's Domain:** [Brief description of the Muse's traditional domain].
*   **Blessing for Task Composition:** Detailed guidelines on how the Muse's essence should be applied to the relevant section(s) of the `task_template.md`.
*   **Practical Examples:** Illustrative examples of how to apply the Muse's blessing.

The concept of "parallel launch" for these SOPs signifies that their principles are intended to be applied simultaneously and holistically during the task composition process, ensuring a multi-faceted and integrated approach to task definition.

### 4.3. Review Process: The 9! Reviews (A Mathematical Meme)

To ensure the highest quality and deepest integration of the Muse-generated content, the review process for the Muse-generated content (e.g., the "votes" integrated into the `task_template.md`) will embody the "9! reviews" mathematical meme.

This concept signifies a rigorous, sequential, and combinatorially complex review process:

*   **Sequential Review:** Each Muse, in a defined order, will review the output blessed by the previous Muse. This creates a chain of refinement and ensures that each blessing is considered in the context of the preceding ones.
*   **Factorial Depth:** The "9!" (362,880) is a metaphorical representation of the exhaustive and thorough nature of this review. It emphasizes that every permutation of influence and perspective is conceptually considered, ensuring a robust and deeply integrated final product.
*   **Mathematical Meme:** This process itself serves as a "mathematical meme," reinforcing the project's core identity of integrating abstract mathematical concepts with creative and philosophical processes.

## 5. Expected Outcomes

*   Formalized and actionable guidance for infusing tasks with the project's artistic and philosophical principles.
*   Enhanced consistency and quality in task definition.
*   Deeper integration of the "Muse Protocol" into the project's operational workflow.
*   Further adherence to the Quality Doctrine by documenting key procedures.

## 6. Rollback Plan

To roll back, this CRQ can be marked as "Deprecated" or "Rejected," and the 9 Muse-specific SOP files can be removed from `docs/sops/`.
