# CRQ-019: Secure Credential Handling in Nix Scripts

## 1. Problem Statement

Nix builds and shell scripts within the project often require access to sensitive credentials, such as GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs), API keys, or other authentication tokens. Directly embedding these credentials in scripts or passing them as plain environment variables poses significant security risks, including accidental exposure in logs, version control, or build artifacts. The current methods for providing credentials to tools like `gh` within Nix build environments are cumbersome and insecure, hindering reproducible and secure development.

**Synonyms for Credential Handling:**
*   Secrets Management
*   Vault Integration
*   Authentication Tokens
*   Sensitive Data Protection
*   Secure Configuration
*   Key Management
*   Access Control
*   Credential Storage
*   Tokenization

## 2. Proposed Solution

Develop and implement a standardized, secure, and auditable method for handling credentials within Nix-managed scripts and builds. This solution should aim for:

*   **Confidentiality**: Credentials should never be exposed in plain text in logs, build outputs, or version control.
*   **Reproducibility**: Builds should remain reproducible, even when sensitive data is involved.
*   **Ease of Use**: The process for developers to provide and utilize credentials should be straightforward.
*   **Auditable**: The mechanism should allow for auditing of credential access.

Proposed approaches to explore:

1.  **Nix-native Secrets Management Tools**: Investigate and integrate existing Nix-specific solutions like `sops-nix` or `agenix` for encrypting and decrypting secrets within Nix derivations.
2.  **Specialized Tool Wrappers**: Create Nix derivations for tools (e.g., `gh`) that wrap them to securely inject credentials at runtime, potentially by reading from a secure location or leveraging a system-level secret manager.
3.  **Environment Variable Injection (Improved)**: If environment variables are used, define strict patterns and ensure they are only exposed to the specific build phases or commands that require them, and never persisted.
4.  **External Vault Integration**: Explore integration with external secret vaults (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) for more complex scenarios.

## 3. Scope

### In Scope
*   Creating this CRQ document.
*   Researching and evaluating existing Nix secrets management solutions.
*   Proposing a concrete technical solution for secure credential handling.
*   Developing necessary Nix expressions or scripts to implement the chosen solution.
*   Updating relevant scripts (e.g., `automate_dependency_forking.sh`) to utilize the new secure credential handling mechanism.
*   Documenting the chosen solution in a new SOP (`docs/sops/SOP_Secure_Credential_Handling_in_Nix_Scripts.md`).

### Out of Scope
*   Developing a new, custom secret vault from scratch.
*   Handling credentials for non-Nix managed systems (unless directly integrated with the Nix solution).

## 4. Technical Details

*   **Tools**: Nix, `gh`, `jq`, `sops-nix` (potential), `agenix` (potential), `bash`.
*   **Key Considerations**: Build isolation, environment purification, user experience, auditability.

## 5. Testing Plan

1.  Verify that credentials are not exposed in plain text in build logs or artifacts.
2.  Ensure that scripts requiring credentials execute successfully within the secure environment.
3.  Test the reproducibility of builds involving credentials.
4.  Verify that the solution is user-friendly for providing credentials.

## 6. Rollback Plan

Revert to previous methods of credential handling (e.g., direct environment variable injection) if the proposed solution proves unfeasible or introduces new issues.

## 7. Future Considerations

*   Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated secure credential injection.
*   Support for different types of credentials (e.g., SSH keys, GPG keys).
