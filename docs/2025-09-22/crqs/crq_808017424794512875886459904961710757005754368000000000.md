# CRQ-021: TikTokification of the Monster Group (Submodule Specific)

## 1. Overview

This Change Request (CRQ) outlines the process of creating and integrating a series of TikTok-style tutorials focused on the Monster Group and related advanced mathematical concepts, specifically within this submodule. The goal is to make complex mathematical ideas accessible and engaging to a broader audience through short-form video content, while also documenting the underlying mathematical principles and their connections to other fields.

## 2. Justification

The "tiktokification" initiative aims to:
*   **Increase Accessibility:** Break down complex mathematical concepts into digestible, visually appealing, and easily shareable content.
*   **Promote Engagement:** Leverage the popular TikTok platform to reach a wider, younger audience and foster interest in abstract mathematics.
*   **Document Knowledge:** Create a structured repository of short-form educational content that can serve as a quick reference or introduction to advanced topics.
*   **Explore New Pedagogical Approaches:** Experiment with innovative ways of teaching and explaining intricate subjects using modern media formats.

## 3. Scope

This CRQ covers:
*   **Content Creation:** Development of scripts, visual aids, and narrative structures for TikTok tutorials on topics such as:
    *   The Monster Group (overview, elements, orders, prime factorization)
    *   Monstrous Moonshine
    *   Sporadic Simple Groups
    *   Mathieu Groups (M11, M12, M22, M23, M24)
    *   Griess Algebra
    *   Vertex Operator Algebras
    *   Related number theory concepts (e.g., Fermat primes, Keith numbers, Bezout's Identity, Euclidean Algorithm, Coprime integers, Centered Hexagonal/Triangular numbers)
    *   Abstract concepts (e.g., Eigenvectors/Eigenvalues, Lattices, Homotopy, Ontology, Riemann Zeta Function)
    *   Interdisciplinary connections (e.g., Gematria, Metonic Cycle, Monster Godel Trace, Fundamental Constants)
*   **Documentation:** Creation of accompanying markdown files for each TikTok tutorial, detailing the mathematical concepts, sources, and potential discussion points.
*   **Integration:** Organizing and linking the TikTok tutorial documentation within this submodule's existing structure.
*   **Keyword Extraction and Caching:** Utilizing scripts to extract keywords from Wikipedia articles and cache relevant information to support content creation.

## 4. Deliverables

*   A series of markdown files (e.g., `monster_group_tiktok_tutorial.md`, `monstrous_moonshine_tiktok_tutorial.md`, etc.) located in the `source/github/meta-introspector/streamofrandom/2025/09/22/` directory.
*   Scripts for extracting links, keywords, and caching Wikipedia articles (e.g., `extract_all_links.sh`, `extract_keywords.sh`, `setup_wikipedia_cache.sh`, `cache_wikipedia_sources.sh`, `extract_keywords_from_wiki_cache.sh`, `extract_wiki_urls.sh`, `spider_wiki_links.sh`).
*   An `all_extracted_links.md` file containing collected links.
*   A `cached_wikipedia_articles.md` file summarizing cached content.
*   A `glossary.md` and `learning_path.md` to support the tutorials.
*   A `tiktok_tutorial_template.md` for consistent content creation.

## 5. Dependencies

*   Access to the internet for Wikipedia article caching.
*   Standard shell utilities for script execution.

## 6. Success Criteria

*   Creation of at least 10 distinct TikTok tutorial markdown files.
*   Successful execution of all associated scripts for link extraction, keyword extraction, and Wikipedia caching.
*   Clear and concise documentation for each mathematical concept covered.
*   The ability to generate TikTok-ready content (scripts/ideas) from the created markdown files.

## 7. Rollback Plan

In case of issues, the changes can be reverted by discarding the new files and reverting modifications to existing files using standard Git commands.
