# CRQ: Emacs Org Mode Integration for Gemini CLI

## Change Request:
This CRQ proposes integrating the `gemini-cli` interaction directly into Emacs Org mode. This integration would allow users to define `gemini-cli` tasks within Org mode documents, execute them, and capture their outputs seamlessly, leveraging Org mode's powerful outlining, task management, and literate programming capabilities.

## Justification:
Org mode is widely used for note-taking, project planning, and literate programming within Emacs. Integrating `gemini-cli` with Org mode would provide a natural and highly productive environment for managing AI-assisted development tasks. Users could define prompts as Org mode blocks, execute them, and have the results automatically inserted back into their Org documents, creating a self-documenting and executable workflow.

## Scope:
- Explore methods for embedding `gemini-cli` prompts within Org mode documents (e.g., using Org Babel source blocks or custom Org mode structures).
- Design a mechanism to execute these embedded prompts and capture their output.
- Implement functionality to insert `gemini-cli` output directly into the Org document, potentially as new Org blocks or properties.
- Consider how to manage `prelude.md` and other context files within an Org mode workflow.

## Deliverables:
- `docs/crqs/CRQ_Emacs_Org_Mode_Integration_for_Gemini_CLI.md` (this document)
- `docs/sops/SOP_Emacs_Org_Mode_Integration_Implementation.md`
- Updated `solfunmeme-gemini.el` and/or new Emacs Lisp files to support Org mode integration.
