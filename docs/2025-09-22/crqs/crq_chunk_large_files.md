# CRQ: Chunk Large Files by Keywords and File Endings

## Request
This Change ReQuest proposes the development and implementation of a system to break down large text files (`~/nix2/file.txt` and `~/pick-up-nix2/file.txt`) into smaller, more manageable chunks. The primary chunking methods will involve identifying keywords and file endings, with flexibility to incorporate other strategies. This CRQ emphasizes an iterative and recursive approach to chunking.

## Justification
Chunking large files is essential for:
- Improving performance and efficiency when processing or analyzing file content.
- Facilitating easier navigation and understanding of complex data.
- Enabling more granular control over data processing workflows.
- Reducing memory footprint during analysis of large datasets.
- Supporting recursive analysis and refinement of data subsets.

## Scope
- Define precise chunking logic based on initial keywords and subsequent sub-terms identified through recursive filtering.
- Develop and implement scripts/code for automated chunk generation, supporting multiple levels of recursion.
- Establish hierarchical conventions for naming and storing generated chunks.
- Implement verification mechanisms to ensure chunking accuracy at each recursive step.
