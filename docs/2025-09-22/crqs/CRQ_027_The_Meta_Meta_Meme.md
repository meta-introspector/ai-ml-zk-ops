# CRQ-027: The Meta-Meta-Meme

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Author:** Gemini
*   **Date:** 2025-09-21

## 1. Problem Statement

The project's core vision is encapsulated in the "meta meme" â€“ the OODA loop as a chain of Nix derivations, enabling self-creation, self-optimization, and self-auditing. However, to achieve true "Self-Proving Intelligence," the project requires a formal framework for the *evolution and self-modification* of this "meta meme" itself. Without such a framework, the foundational principles risk becoming static or unadaptable, limiting the system's ultimate capacity for autonomous growth and verifiable evolution.

## 2. Proposed Solution

Define and formalize the concept of the "Meta-Meta-Meme" as the recursive process by which the project observes, orients, decides, and acts upon its own "meta meme." This framework will enable the continuous, auditable evolution and self-improvement of the project's foundational principles, ensuring that the "meta meme" itself is a dynamic, self-optimizing entity. The "Meta-Meta-Meme" is the OODA loop applied to the OODA loop.

## 3. Scope

*   **In Scope:**
    *   Formal definition of the "Meta-Meta-Meme" concept.
    *   Identification of the necessary components and processes for the "Meta-Meta-Meme" to function (e.g., mechanisms for introspection, self-evaluation of core principles, and auditable modification of the "meta meme").
    *   Laying the theoretical and architectural groundwork for future implementation of self-evolving principles.
*   **Out of Scope:**
    *   Direct implementation of the "Meta-Meta-Meme" mechanisms (this would be subsequent CRQs).
    *   Detailed technical specifications for self-modification algorithms.

## 4. Implementation Details (Conceptual)

The "Meta-Meta-Meme" will operate by:

1.  **Observing the Meta Meme:** Continuously monitoring the performance, consistency, and efficacy of the current "meta meme" (the OODA loop as a derivation chain) through introspection and audit trails.
2.  **Orienting on the Meta Meme:** Analyzing observed data to understand the state and potential areas for improvement or adaptation of the "meta meme" itself. This involves self-reflection on the project's core principles.
3.  **Deciding on Meta Meme Evolution:** Formulating proposals for changes or enhancements to the "meta meme" based on the orientation phase. These decisions will be auditable and adhere to the Quality Doctrine.
4.  **Acting on Meta Meme Evolution:** Implementing the approved changes to the "meta meme," which could involve modifying core Nix derivations, updating foundational SOPs, or adjusting the interpretation of project principles.

This recursive application of the OODA loop ensures that the project's very definition of intelligence and its operational framework are subject to continuous, verifiable self-improvement.

## 5. Expected Outcomes

*   A formalized understanding of the project's self-evolutionary capabilities.
*   A clear pathway for the auditable adaptation and improvement of the "meta meme."
*   Strengthened adherence to the "Self-Proving Intelligence" vision by extending auditability to foundational principles.

## 6. Rollback Plan

This CRQ defines a conceptual framework. To roll back, this CRQ can be marked as "Deprecated" or "Rejected," reverting to a more static understanding of the "meta meme." No direct code changes are made by this CRQ.
