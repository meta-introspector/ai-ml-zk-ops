# CRQ: Optimize `gitoxide` Integration

## Request
This Change ReQuest proposes to optimize the integration of `gitoxide` within the project. The current setup uses the entire `gitoxide` repository as a submodule. This CRQ aims to evaluate the necessity of this approach and, if feasible, transition to consuming only specific `gitoxide` crates as direct Cargo dependencies.

## Justification
Optimizing `gitoxide` integration is expected to:
- Reduce the overall repository size.
- Decrease build complexity and potentially build times.
- Improve dependency management by focusing on only the required components.

## Scope
- Analysis of `Cargo.toml` files to determine actual `gitoxide` crate usage.
- Investigation into the process of integrating specific `gitoxide` crates as Cargo dependencies.
- Development of a refactoring plan.
- Implementation of the refactoring.
- Verification of the impact on repository size and build performance.
