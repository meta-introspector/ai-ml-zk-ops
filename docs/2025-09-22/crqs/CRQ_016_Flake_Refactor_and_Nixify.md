## Title
CRQ-016: Flake Refactoring and Submodule Nixification

## Description
This Change Request documents the extensive refactoring of the project's root `flake.nix` and the standardization of Nix environments across all `meta-introspector` submodules. The initial `nix develop` failures were traced back to issues with nested local flake dependencies and inconsistent `flake.nix` files within the submodules.

## Motivation
To create a stable, reproducible, and consistent Nix-based development environment across the entire project, including all its submodules. This will simplify onboarding, reduce "works on my machine" issues, and improve the overall maintainability of the project.

## Changes Implemented
1.  **Root Flake Refactoring:** The root `flake.nix` was refactored to remove nested local flakes. It now points directly to the `meta-introspector` forks of the required Nix tool repositories on GitHub, pinned to a specific tag for reproducibility.
2.  **Submodule Nixification:**
    -   A standardized `flake.nix` template was created to provide a consistent, minimal development shell for all submodules.
    -   A `nixify.sh` script was developed to apply this template to all `meta-introspector` submodules, creating backups of existing `flake.nix` files.
3.  **Automation Scripts:**
    -   A `commit_and_push_flakes.sh` script was created to automate the process of committing the standardized `flake.nix` files, tagging them with an `alpha` tag, and pushing them to the `meta-introspector` forks.

## Impact
-   A robust and reliable `nix develop` experience.
-   A standardized and easily maintainable Nix environment for all submodules.
-   A clear and automated process for managing submodule flake files.
