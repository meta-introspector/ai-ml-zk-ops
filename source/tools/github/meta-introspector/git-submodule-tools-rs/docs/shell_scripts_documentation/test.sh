## `test.sh`

**Summary:**
This script is designed to be *sourced* by other scripts (not run directly) to derive a `LAST_TIMESTAMP` variable. It searches the `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/` directory for the most recently modified file matching the pattern `files_list_*.txt`. If such a file is found, it extracts its last modification timestamp (Unix epoch) and assigns it to `LAST_TIMESTAMP`. If no such file is found, `LAST_TIMESTAMP` defaults to 0. This script provides a mechanism for other scripts (like `index_newer_files.sh`) to determine a baseline timestamp for processing only newly modified files.
