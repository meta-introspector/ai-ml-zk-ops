# CRQ-XXX: Dynamic Nix Flake Generation for Prime Number Representation

## 1. Problem Statement

The need to represent fundamental mathematical entities, such as prime numbers, as distinct and content-addressable Nix packages is emerging from the Unimath initiative. Manually creating individual Nix flakes for each prime number is inefficient and does not leverage Nix's capabilities for dynamic generation. A method is required to programmatically generate Nix flakes that encapsulate these entities, demonstrating the power of dynamic derivations for fine-grained content addressability.

## 2. Proposed Solution

Implement a system for dynamically generating Nix flakes, where each flake represents a unique prime number. This will involve creating a master `flake.nix` that, at evaluation time, constructs individual derivations for a predefined set of prime numbers. Each generated derivation will produce a package containing a `prime_number.txt` file, whose content is the respective prime. This approach will serve as a proof-of-concept for:

- Leveraging dynamic derivations to create a multitude of similar, yet distinct, Nix packages.
- Establishing a pattern for representing mathematical entities as content-addressable Nix artifacts.
- Laying groundwork for the Unimath project's goal of packaging every number, token, and bit.

## 3. Scope

- Create a `dynamic_prime_flakes` directory.
- Develop a `flake.nix` within `dynamic_prime_flakes` that dynamically generates packages for the first 8 prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19).
- Each generated package (e.g., `prime-2`, `prime-3`) will contain a `prime_number.txt` file with the corresponding prime number as its content.
- Demonstrate the dynamic derivation process through the structure of the `flake.nix`.

## 4. Technical Details

- **Nix Flake Structure:** The master `flake.nix` will utilize `lib.genAttrs` or a similar Nix function to iterate over a list of prime numbers.
- **Dynamic Derivation:** For each prime, a `derivation` will be created. This derivation will use `pkgs.writeText` or a similar builder to generate a `prime_number.txt` file containing the prime number.
- **Package Naming:** The generated packages will be named descriptively (e.g., `prime-2`, `prime-3`).
- **Output:** The `flake.nix` will expose these dynamically generated packages as outputs.

## 5. Testing Strategy

- **Evaluation Test:** Verify that the master `flake.nix` evaluates successfully without errors.
- **Build Test:** Attempt to build each dynamically generated package (e.g., `nix build .#prime-2`) to ensure it completes successfully.
- **Content Verification:** Inspect the output of each built package to confirm that `prime_number.txt` exists and contains the correct prime number.
- **Reproducibility:** Ensure that repeated builds of the same package yield identical results.

## 6. Rollback Plan

This CRQ focuses on a new, isolated proof-of-concept. In case of issues, the `dynamic_prime_flakes` directory and its contents can be removed without affecting other parts of the project.

## 7. Dependencies

- Nix package manager (with flake support enabled).

## 8. Future Considerations

- Extend the dynamic generation to a larger set of prime numbers or other mathematical constants.
- Integrate semantic hashing into the dynamically generated flakes, making them truly content-addressable based on their prime value.
- Explore generating more complex derivations that encode properties or functions related to the prime numbers.
- Use these dynamically generated prime flakes as building blocks within the Unimath project.
