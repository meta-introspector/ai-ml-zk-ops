# CRQ-XXX: Nix Package Contextualization and Metadata Embedding

## 1. Problem Statement

Nix packages, while excellent for reproducibility, currently lack a standardized and comprehensive mechanism for embedding rich contextual metadata directly within their definitions. This absence hinders discoverability, semantic understanding, automated analysis, and advanced integration with tools like Large Language Models (LLMs). Key information such as conceptual keywords, provenance details, functional characteristics, and operational requirements often remains external or unstructured, limiting the full potential of a content-addressable build system.

## 2. Proposed Solution

Introduce a framework for "Nix Package Contextualization and Metadata Embedding." This initiative aims to define standards and tools for integrating a wide array of contextual information directly into Nix package expressions. By doing so, each Nix package will become a self-describing entity, facilitating:

- Enhanced semantic search and discovery based on embedded metadata.
- Improved traceability and provenance tracking throughout the package lifecycle.
- Automated generation of documentation and LLM-consumable knowledge graphs.
- Advanced analysis and verification of package properties.
- Seamless integration with future systems like Unimath and `nix-dynamic-pkg-expr-introspector` by providing a common metadata layer.

## 3. Scope

- Define a schema or set of conventions for various types of package metadata (semantic, provenance, functional, operational).
- Develop tools (Nix functions, scripts) to facilitate the embedding and extraction of this metadata.
- Integrate with existing Nix features (e.g., attributes, `meta` section) and propose extensions where necessary.
- Provide mechanisms for automatically deriving certain metadata (e.g., Git commit hash, keywords from content).
- Ensure compatibility with content-addressable principles and semantic hashing.
- Develop initial examples demonstrating the contextualization of a few representative Nix packages.

## 4. Technical Details

- **Metadata Schema:** Design a flexible and extensible schema for package metadata, potentially leveraging existing standards (e.g., SPDX for licenses, Dublin Core for general metadata) or defining a custom Nix-native structure.
- **Nix Attribute Integration:** Utilize Nix's attribute sets to store key-value pairs of metadata. For complex data, consider structured attribute sets or references to external files.
- **Automated Metadata Extraction:** Develop Nix functions or external scripts to automatically extract metadata such as keywords (e.g., using NLP on documentation), Git commit information, and build environment details.
- **Semantic Hashing Integration:** Ensure that embedded metadata can be semantically hashed and contribute to the overall content addressability of the package.
- **LLM Query Generation:** Design metadata fields that explicitly support the generation of lattice queries for LLMs, enabling AI-driven package interaction.
- **Provenance Tracking:** Embed Git commit hashes, author information, and source URLs to provide a complete audit trail for each package.
- **Unimath/CRQ Linkage:** Include attributes to link packages to relevant CRQs and Unimath entities, creating a rich interlinked knowledge graph.

## 5. Testing Strategy

- **Schema Validation:** Develop tests to ensure that embedded metadata conforms to the defined schema.
- **Metadata Integrity:** Verify that automated metadata extraction processes are accurate and consistent.
- **Content Addressability:** Test that changes in metadata correctly impact the package's content hash.
- **LLM Integration Tests:** Develop tests to validate the effectiveness of LLM query generation from package metadata.
- **Round-trip Tests:** Ensure that metadata can be embedded and extracted without loss of information.

## 6. Rollback Plan

The contextualization framework will be implemented incrementally. Existing packages will not be forced to adopt the new metadata immediately. Tools will be designed to be backward-compatible, allowing for a gradual transition. In case of issues, the metadata embedding can be disabled or ignored without affecting the core functionality of Nix packages.

## 7. Dependencies

- Nix package manager
- `nix-dynamic-pkg-expr-introspector` (for semantic hashing infrastructure)
- Potential NLP tools for keyword extraction.

## 8. Future Considerations

- Develop a dedicated CLI tool for querying and visualizing package metadata.
- Integrate with external knowledge graphs and semantic web technologies.
- Explore dynamic metadata generation based on package usage patterns.
- Create a web-based portal for browsing and searching contextualized Nix packages.
- Extend the concept to other Nix artifacts beyond packages (e.g., modules, flakes).
- Implement a system for assigning unique prime numbers to Nix flakes, where these prime numbers are imported from a curated list and assigned without conflicts. The assignment process can take the flake's hash as an input, allowing for a cryptographic linkage between the flake's content and its unique prime identifier.
