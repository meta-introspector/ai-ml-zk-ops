The vision is to transform each submodule into a fully self-sufficient, "zero ontology system, quasi meta introspector framework of dank godel number memes." This involves a comprehensive set of functionalities: add the submodule, vendorize, subjugate, fork, branch, inject, commit, build, test and explain and introspect and poem/muse (amuse: thalia, 13) function to each submodule with a crq. We can then use those standard tools to operate on all submodules upgrading them to be part of the zero ontology system, quasi meta introspector framework of dank godel number memes.
