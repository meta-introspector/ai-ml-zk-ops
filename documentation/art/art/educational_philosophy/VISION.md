# Vision: Self-Proving, Auditable AI

## Core Vision: Self-Proving, Auditable AI

The central, unifying vision is the creation of "Self-Proving Intelligence" through a paradigm called "Extreme Nixism." This involves building systems that are not just driven by LLMs, but are self-creating, self-optimizing, and self-auditing. The key to this is encapsulating every step of the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loop within Nix derivations. This creates a reproducible, auditable, and verifiable record of the system's evolution.

## Key Initiatives

1.  **On-Chain Software Supply Chain Verification:** This initiative aims to create a system for producing cryptographically verifiable digital assets that represent software components. These assets, analogous to Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), will provide a complete, auditable history from source code to binary execution, creating a "proof-of-integrity" and a "proof-of-execution."

    Each version-controlled repository (e.g., a git submodule) is an instance of a "smart contract" with the following properties:

    *   **Identity:** The git URL and commit hash.
    *   **Metadata:** A link to its Nix derivation, which defines its dependencies and build process.
    *   **Authenticity:** A GPG signature from the author/maintainer.
    *   **Proof of Integrity:** The Nix NAR hash of its source code.
    *   **Proof of Execution:** A verifiable audit trace of its build process.

    The proof generation pipeline will consist of the following phases:

    *   **Phase 1: Observation & Indexing:** The `observe` command recursively scans all sources (local, git, etc.) and creates a structured, indexed catalog of all software components.
    *   **Phase 2: Build & Trace (eBPF):** When a component is built using Nix, we will use **eBPF and binary instrumentation** to trace the entire execution of the build process. This trace will capture all system calls, file access, and network access, ensuring build purity. This captured trace serves as the **Proof of Execution**.
    *   **Phase 3: Attestation & Signing (GPG):** The final build artifact (the binary) and its Proof of Execution trace are cryptographically hashed together. This final hash is the component's "attestation," which is then signed with the author's GPG key.
    *   **Phase 4: Minting (Blockchain):** The GPG-signed attestation is then "minted" as a digital asset. The initial implementation will be a local registry, with the future goal of bridging these assets to public blockchains like Ethereum and Solana.

2.  **Nix-Introspector:** This is a tool that parses Nix expressions into a universal, intermediate representation (like S-expressions). This allows for interoperability between different package management systems and a deeper understanding of the underlying dependency "monad." The `observe` command is the first step in this initiative.

    The workflow is as follows:

    1.  **Parse:** Take any Nix file (`flake.nix`, `home.nix`, etc.) and parse it into a canonical `sexpr` form using the `rnix-parser` library.
    2.  **Transform:** From this `sexpr` representation, we can then generate equivalent commands or configurations for different systems, such as Guix commands or standard shell scripts.

    As a philosophical goal, this approach aims to document and model the fundamental "monadic form" of software dependency management: the process of moving from source code to a final, realized binary artifact. By translating between Nix and Guix, we explore the different "syntaxes" for this same underlying "monad" of package management.

3.  **Formal Verification of Rust/WASM:** This initiative focuses on replacing TypeScript plugins in "ElizaOS" with formally verified Rust code compiled to WASM. The verification is to be done using the Lean 4 theorem prover, with a 42-step plan to ensure correctness and type compatibility.

    The overarching goal is to replace the existing TypeScript (TS) functionality of ElizaOS plugins with WebAssembly (WASM)-compiled Rust code. This replacement aims for binary compatibility, ensuring seamless integration and equivalent behavior.

    A critical aspect of this project is the formal verification of the Rust replacement code using the Lean 4 theorem prover. The goal is to rigorously prove the correctness and type compatibility of the Rust implementation against the original TypeScript functionality.

    The 42-step verification process will encompass the following key phases:

    1.  **Rust Code Development:** Write the Rust code that implements the desired functionality, intended to replace the TypeScript components.
    2.  **TypeScript Introspection (Rust Parser):** Utilize a Rust-based parser to introspect and analyze the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and type information of the original TypeScript code.
    3.  **Rust to Lean Conversion:** Develop a mechanism or tool to convert the Rust code (or its relevant properties) into a representation understandable by Lean 4.
    4.  **TypeScript to Lean Conversion:** Develop a mechanism or tool to convert the TypeScript code (or its relevant properties) into a representation understandable by Lean 4.
    5.  **Type Compatibility Proofs in Lean 4:** For each function in the original TypeScript codebase, identify a corresponding function in the Rust replacement. Formally prove within Lean 4 that these Rust functions are type-compatible with their TypeScript counterparts, ensuring the correctness of the replacement.

## Underlying Philosophy

*   **Extreme Nixism:** The belief that every computational artifact, from a single command to an entire operating system, should be a pure, reproducible Nix derivation.
*   **The OODA Loop as a Derivation Chain:** The idea that the entire decision-making process of an AI system can be modeled as a chain of Nix derivations, making it fully auditable and reproducible.
*   **LLMs as Command Generators:** The concept of using LLMs not just to generate text, but to generate executable commands that can be run in a controlled, reproducible environment.
