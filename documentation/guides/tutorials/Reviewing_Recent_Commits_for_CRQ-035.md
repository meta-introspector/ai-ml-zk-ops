# Reviewing Recent Commits for CRQ-035

This tutorial outlines the steps to review recent Git commits, focusing on their relevance to CRQ-035: Monster Group as Clifford Multivector. This process is designed to be resilient to interruptions, allowing for easy resumption.

## 1. Generate Recent Commit Log

To get a log of all commits from the last 4 days, execute the following script:

```bash
/data/data/com.termux.nix/files/home/pick-up-nix2/scripts/generate_recent_commits_log.sh /data/data/com.termux.nix/files/home/pick-up-nix2/index/recent_commits.log
```

This command will create or update the file `/data/data/com.termux.nix/files/home/pick-up-nix2/index/recent_commits.log` with the commit history.

## 2. View the Recent Commit Log

You can view the generated commit log using your preferred text editor or a command-line tool:

```bash
cat /data/data/com.termux.nix/files/home/pick-up-nix2/index/recent_commits.log
```

## 3. Analyze Commits in Relation to CRQ-035

When reviewing the `recent_commits.log`, pay attention to commit messages and changes that might be related to:

*   **CRQ-035: Monster Group as Clifford Multivector:** Look for keywords like "Monster Group," "Clifford Multivector," "CRQ-035," "Nixification," "LLM context generation," "NAR mapping," etc.
*   **`generate_monster_group_llm_txt.sh`:** Any commits that modify or introduce this script, or its dependencies (e.g., the `HTML_FILE`, `KEYWORDS_SCRIPT`, `LINKS_FILE` mentioned in `tasks/CRQ-035_Clifford_Multivector_Compression_Ideas.md`).
*   **Nix Flake changes:** Commits related to `flake.nix` or other Nix files that might impact the build or generation of Monster Group related data.
*   **Documentation updates:** Changes to `docs/crqs/CRQ_035_Monster_Group_Clifford_Multivector.md` or `tasks/CRQ-035_Clifford_Multivector_Compression_Ideas.md`.

### Example Analysis Workflow:

1.  **Identify potentially relevant commits:** Scan the commit messages for keywords related to CRQ-035.
2.  **Examine commit details:** For each relevant commit, you might want to view the full diff to understand the changes introduced. You can do this using the commit hash:
    ```bash
    git show <commit_hash>
    ```
3.  **Trace file changes:** If a commit modifies a file relevant to CRQ-035, note the changes and how they impact the overall task.

## 4. Resuming After Interruption

If interrupted, you can always re-run the `generate_recent_commits_log.sh` script to refresh the commit log. Then, continue your analysis from where you left off, using the `recent_commits.log` and `git show <commit_hash>` to review specific changes.
