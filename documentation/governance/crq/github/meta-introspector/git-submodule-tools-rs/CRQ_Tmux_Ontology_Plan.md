## CRQ: Formalize Tmux-Related Concepts into ZOS-aligned Rust Model

**Objective:** To conceptually model key "vibes" related to Tmux files using `zos`-aligned prime numbers and emojis, and represent these relationships within a Rust structure, linking them to abstract mathematical concepts (Clifford multivectors, 8D manifolds, the lattice).

**High-Level Steps (for Gemini Agent):**

1.  **Subtask 1.1: Identify "Key Vibes" from Tmux File List.**
    *   **Objective:** Extract abstract concepts or "key vibes" from the provided list of Tmux-related files.
    *   **Description:** Review the file paths and names in `tmux-plan.md` under "DOCS", "REVIEW AND RENAME", "CRATES", "SCRIPTS USING TMUX", and "Packages" to identify recurring themes, functionalities, or conceptual categories.
    *   **Scope:** Analysis of `tmux-plan.md`.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** A list of 5-10 distinct "key vibes" related to Tmux functionality or its role in the project.
    *   **Assigned Agent:** Gemini (Self-assigned)
    *   **Status:** To Do

2.  **Subtask 1.2: Map Key Vibes to ZOS Primes and Emojis.**
    *   **Objective:** Assign a unique prime number (from `zos` or extended primes) and a unique emoji string to each identified "key vibe."
    *   **Description:** For each "key vibe" from Subtask 1.1, select an appropriate prime number and an emoji that symbolically represents it.
    *   **Scope:** Conceptual mapping.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** A clear mapping table of "Key Vibe" -> "Prime Number" -> "Emoji String".
    *   **Assigned Agent:** Gemini (Self-assigned)
    *   **Status:** To Do

3.  **Subtask 1.3: Create Rust Model for Key Vibes.**
    *   **Objective:** Implement a Rust model (using enums, structs, functions) to represent the "key vibes" and their conceptual relationships.
    *   **Description:**
        *   Define a Rust `enum` for the "key vibes."
        *   Associate each enum variant with its prime number and emoji.
        *   Consider how to represent the "Clifford multivector," "8D manifold point," and "lattice point" conceptually within the Rust model (e.g., as associated data, or methods that return symbolic representations). This will be abstract, not a literal mathematical implementation.
    *   **Scope:** New Rust crate (e.g., `crates/tmux_ontology_model`).
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A new Rust crate compiles successfully.
        *   The Rust model correctly represents the "key vibes" and their associated prime numbers and emojis.
        *   The model includes symbolic representations or methods for the abstract mathematical concepts.
    *   **Assigned Agent:** Gemini (Self-assigned)
    *   **Status:** To Do

4.  **Subtask 1.4: Document the Tmux Ontology Model.**
    *   **Objective:** Document the created Rust model and its conceptual underpinnings.
    *   **Description:** Create a Markdown document (e.g., `docs/tmux_ontology.md`) explaining the "key vibes," their mapping, the Rust model, and the conceptual links to Clifford multivectors, 8D manifolds, and the lattice.
    *   **Scope:** New Markdown file in `docs/`.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   `docs/tmux_ontology.md` is created and clearly explains the model.
        *   The document reinforces the project's meta-narrative.
    *   **Assigned Agent:** Gemini (Self-assigned)
    *   **Status:** To Do
