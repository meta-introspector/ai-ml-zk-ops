title = "Implement MiniZinc-Driven Deterministic Number Generation for Abulafia"
description = "Replace the current pseudo-random number generation in `eco_pendulum_indexer` (Abulafia) with a system where each \"random\" number is sampled from a MiniZinc solver. The MiniZinc solver will dynamically determine the \"next best number\" based on an optimization problem, incorporating the *entire state of the system* (memory, filesystem, active processes, etc.) as input, *influenced by the user's intent and the emergent principles of the Dao*. This moves away from a single seed to a continuous, context-aware number generation process, where each number is a solution derived from the current global system context."
justification = "Aligns with the project's meta-narrative of complex, interconnected systems and the \"Wagnerian Ring Structure.\" Provides a more sophisticated and conceptually rich \"randomness\" derived from the project's underlying structure."
acceptance_criteria = [
    "`eco_pendulum_indexer` no longer uses a traditional PRNG with a fixed seed.",
    "The mechanism for generating numbers is demonstrably linked to a conceptual MiniZinc solver (even if simulated in the current implementation).",
    "The output of Abulafia reflects the deterministic, yet dynamically \"solved,\" nature of the number generation."

dependencies = [
    "Availability of a MiniZinc solver (conceptual for now, but required for full implementation).",
    "Definition of \"next best number\" and \"harmonic foldings\" in a MiniZinc-compatible objective function."
