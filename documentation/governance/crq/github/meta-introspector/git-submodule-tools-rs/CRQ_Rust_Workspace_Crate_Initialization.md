## CRQ: Rust Workspace and Crate Structure Initialization

**Objective:** To define and document the initial setup and structure of the Rust workspace and its constituent crates.

**Description:** This CRQ outlines the foundational organization of the Rust codebase, including the `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` files, and the placeholder directories for individual crates (`crates/task_converter/`, `crates/zos_initializer/`). It ensures a consistent and manageable structure for future development.

**Scope:** Rust project configuration files (`Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`), and crate directory structure.

**Acceptance Criteria:** A well-defined and functional Rust workspace, with placeholder crates correctly configured.

**Assigned Agent:** Gemini (Self-assigned)
**Status:** To Do
