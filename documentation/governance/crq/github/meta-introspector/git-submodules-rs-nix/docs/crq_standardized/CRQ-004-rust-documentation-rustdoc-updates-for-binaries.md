# CRQ-004-rustdoc-updates.md

## Change Request: Rust Documentation (Rustdoc) Updates for Binaries

### Objective

To enhance the internal code documentation for all relevant Rust binaries within the project, ensuring clarity, completeness, and adherence to high quality standards, thereby improving code maintainability and developer understanding.

### Description

This task involves reviewing and updating the `rustdoc` comments within the source code of identified Rust binaries. The updates will focus on:

*   Adding comprehensive module-level documentation.
*   Ensuring all public functions, structs, enums, and traits have clear and concise documentation.
*   Providing examples where appropriate to illustrate usage.
*   Updating existing documentation to reflect any code changes or new functionalities.
*   Ensuring documentation adheres to Rust's standard `rustdoc` formatting and best practices.

Upon completion of the documentation updates, the `rustdoc` will be generated to reflect these changes.

### Expected Outcome

*   All identified Rust binaries will have updated and improved `rustdoc` comments.
*   The generated `rustdoc` output will be comprehensive and easy to navigate, serving as a valuable resource for developers.

### Justification/Benefit

*   **Improved Code Clarity:** Well-documented code is easier to understand and reason about.
*   **Enhanced Maintainability:** Reduces the effort required for future modifications and bug fixes.
*   **Developer Onboarding:** Accelerates the learning curve for new contributors.
*   **Quality Assurance:** Contributes to the overall quality management system by ensuring internal documentation meets defined standards (aligned with ISO 9000 principles).

### Dependencies

*   Identification of all Rust binaries requiring documentation updates.
