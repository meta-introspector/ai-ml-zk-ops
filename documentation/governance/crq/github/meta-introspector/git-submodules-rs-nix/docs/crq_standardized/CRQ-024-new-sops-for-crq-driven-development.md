# CRQ-024-New_SOPs_for_CRQ_Driven_Development.md

## Change Request: New SOPs for CRQ-Driven Development

### Objective

To introduce two new Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that provide practical guidance for implementing the "Bootstrap CRQ Hypothesis" and for systematically refactoring code using CRQ-driven branches.

### Description

This CRQ covers the addition of the following two SOP documents to the `docs/sops/` directory:

1.  **`SOP_Bootstrap_CRQ_Hypothesis_Implementation.md`:** This SOP outlines the practical steps and principles for implementing the "Bootstrap CRQ Hypothesis" (`CRQ-022`). It details how every change should be a CRQ, the importance of CRQ-driven branching, incremental system construction, living documentation, and the criteria for 100% readiness for merge.

2.  **`SOP_Refactoring_with_CRQ_Branches.md`:** This SOP provides a systematic approach for refactoring existing code. It guides on identifying refactoring CRQs, creating dedicated branches for them, making safe and incremental changes, ensuring 100% readiness for merge, and leveraging automation support.

These SOPs are crucial for translating the philosophical concepts of CRQ-driven development into actionable practices, ensuring consistency and quality across the project.

### Expected Outcome

*   Clear, actionable guidelines for implementing the Bootstrap CRQ Hypothesis.
*   A standardized process for refactoring code into CRQ-driven branches.
*   Improved adherence to the project's development philosophy.

### Justification/Benefit

*   **Practical Guidance:** Provides concrete steps for developers to follow.
*   **Consistency:** Ensures a uniform approach to development and refactoring.
*   **Quality Assurance:** Supports the creation of high-quality, well-documented code.
*   **Training Aid:** Serves as a valuable resource for onboarding new team members to the project's development methodology.

### Dependencies

*   Understanding of `CRQ-022-Bootstrap_CRQ_Hypothesis.md`.
*   Team commitment to adopting these new procedures.
