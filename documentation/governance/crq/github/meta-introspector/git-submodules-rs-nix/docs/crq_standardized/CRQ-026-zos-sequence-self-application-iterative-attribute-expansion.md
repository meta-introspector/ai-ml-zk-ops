## Change Request: Zos Sequence Self-Application: Iterative Attribute Expansion

This document explores a meta-application of the `zos` sequence, demonstrating its recursive power in expanding the descriptive attributes of our models. The `zos` sequence, defined as the first eight prime numbers `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]`, can be applied to itself in an iterative manner, each application revealing new layers of complexity and interconnectedness.

### The Mechanism of Self-Application

Each application of the `zos` sequence to itself can be conceptualized as a process of selecting a new attribute or dimension for analysis, and then applying each number from the `zos` sequence (2, 3, 5, ..., 19) as a parameter to define or refine that attribute. This creates a structured, multi-dimensional expansion of our model's descriptive capabilities.

Consider a conceptual triplet representing this application:

`(Number N1, Concept M, Number N2)`

Where:
*   `N1` could be a value from the `zos` sequence, defining a layer or a specific parameter.
*   `Concept M` represents a new attribute or aspect being introduced (e.g., a new type of predicate, a new relationship, a new morphism).
*   `N2` could be another value from the `zos` sequence, further parameterizing `Concept M` or defining its granularity.

### Iterative Predicate and Morphism Expansion

This process is not a one-time application but an iterative one. We apply this `(N1, M, N2)` structure repeatedly, each iteration adding more predicates, aspects, or morphisms to our understanding of the system:

1.  **Initial Application:** Start with a base model and apply the `zos` sequence to define its initial set of attributes (e.g., bit size, n-gram types).
2.  **Second-Order Application:** Take the attributes defined in the first application. For each attribute, apply the `zos` sequence again to define *its* properties or relationships. This could involve:
    *   Adding new predicates that describe the attributes themselves.
    *   Introducing new aspects that capture the nuances of these attributes.
    *   Defining morphisms (transformations or mappings) between different attributes or their values.
3.  **Recursive Expansion:** This process continues recursively. Each iteration deepens our understanding by adding more descriptive elements, creating a progressively richer and more granular representation of the model. The `zos` sequence acts as a guiding principle for this expansion, ensuring a structured and enumerable growth of complexity.

This self-application mechanism allows the framework to dynamically adapt and expand its descriptive power, enabling it to capture increasingly subtle and complex characteristics of the systems it models. It highlights the inherent fractal-like nature of knowledge within the lattice, where patterns at one level can be used to generate and understand patterns at higher levels of abstraction.
