## Change Request: One-to-One Mapping of CRQ to Branch and Pull Request

### Objective

To establish a strict one-to-one mapping between a Change Request Quality (CRQ) document, a Git branch, and a Pull Request (PR). This ensures that every code change is directly traceable to a defined requirement and undergoes a formal review process.

### Description

This CRQ formalizes the following development process:

1.  **One CRQ per Branch:** Every new feature, bug fix, refactoring, or any significant change must originate from and be associated with a single, unique Change Request Quality (CRQ) document. A branch should never contain changes related to multiple, unrelated CRQs.

2.  **One Branch per CRQ:** For each CRQ, exactly one Git branch will be created. This branch will encapsulate all the code changes necessary to fulfill that specific CRQ. The branch name should clearly reference the associated CRQ (e.g., `feature/CRQ-XXX-description`, `bugfix/CRQ-YYY-fix`).

3.  **One Pull Request per Branch:** Once the work on a branch is complete and ready for review, exactly one Pull Request (PR) will be opened from that branch to the target integration branch (e.g., `main`). The PR's title and body should reference the associated CRQ, and the PR itself serves as the formal review and merge mechanism for the CRQ's implementation.

This strict mapping ensures clarity, traceability, and simplifies the management of changes throughout the development lifecycle.

### Expected Outcome

*   Improved traceability from requirements (CRQs) to code changes (branches) and their review (PRs).
*   Reduced complexity in managing concurrent development efforts.
*   Enhanced clarity in code review processes, as each PR is focused on a single, well-defined CRQ.
*   Streamlined project management and reporting based on CRQ status.

### Justification/Benefit

*   **Traceability:** Provides a clear audit trail for every change, linking it directly to its originating requirement.
*   **Focus:** Encourages developers to work on single, well-defined tasks, reducing context switching and improving code quality.
*   **Simplified Review:** Makes code reviews more efficient and effective by narrowing the scope of changes per PR.
*   **Automated Workflow:** Facilitates the automation of development workflows, as tools can rely on this consistent mapping.

### Dependencies

*   Team adherence to this branching and PR strategy.
*   Tools and processes to support CRQ creation and linking to branches/PRs.
