## Change Request: The CRQ of CRQs

### Objective

To establish a foundational Change Request Quality (CRQ) document that defines the purpose, structure, and lifecycle of all other CRQ documents within the project. This meta-CRQ aims to ensure consistency, clarity, and effectiveness across all change requests.

### Description

This CRQ outlines the principles and guidelines for creating and managing CRQ documents. It addresses:

*   **Purpose of a CRQ:** Clearly defining why CRQs are used (e.g., formalizing changes, ensuring quality, traceability).
*   **Standard Structure:** Recommending a consistent format for all CRQs, including sections like Objective, Description, Expected Outcome, Justification/Benefit, and Dependencies.
*   **Lifecycle of a CRQ:** Describing the typical stages a CRQ goes through (e.g., drafting, review, approval, implementation, closure).
*   **Relationship to Commits:** Reinforcing the practice of using CRQs directly as commit messages where appropriate, as established in `SOP_CRQ_as_Commit_Message.md`.
*   **Versioning and Naming Conventions:** Guidelines for naming and versioning CRQ files (e.g., `CRQ-XXX-Descriptive_Name.md`).

### Expected Outcome

*   A clear, comprehensive, and accessible guide for creating high-quality CRQ documents.
*   Improved consistency and standardization across all project change requests.
*   Enhanced traceability between project changes, documentation, and code.
*   Streamlined process for managing and reviewing changes.

### Justification/Benefit

*   **Process Improvement:** Provides a structured approach to managing changes, reducing ambiguity and errors.
*   **Quality Assurance:** Ensures that all changes are well-defined, justified, and properly documented.
*   **Knowledge Management:** Centralizes guidelines for CRQ creation, making it easier for new and existing contributors to adhere to standards.
*   **Compliance:** Supports adherence to quality management principles by formalizing change documentation.

### Dependencies

*   `SOP_CRQ_as_Commit_Message.md` (for reinforcing the commit message practice).
*   Agreement from project stakeholders on the outlined principles.
