# Standard Operating Procedure: Optimize `gitoxide` Integration

## Description
This SOP outlines the procedure to evaluate if the entire `gitoxide` repository is necessary as a submodule. If only specific crates are used, consider consuming them directly as Cargo dependencies to reduce repository size and build complexity. If deep integration or custom modifications are required, the current approach is appropriate.

## Procedure:
1.  **Analyze `Cargo.toml`**: Analyze `Cargo.toml` files to identify specific `gitoxide` crates being used.
2.  **Research Cargo Integration**: Research how to integrate specific `gitoxide` crates as Cargo dependencies.
3.  **Propose Refactoring Plan**: Propose a plan for refactoring `gitoxide` integration.
4.  **Implement Refactoring**: Implement the refactoring and verify its impact on repository size and build times.
