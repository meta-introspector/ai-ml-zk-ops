# Standard Operating Procedure: Develop a Reproducible Digital Mycelium for Meta-AI Life Simulation

## Objective:
Explore and implement the concept of a "digital mycelium" using Nix derivations to track task outputs, forming the basis for a quasi meta-AI life simulation. This involves leveraging Nix's reproducibility to create a traceable and evolving system.

## Idea:

Utilize Nix to create derivations for each task, meticulously tracking all resulting files. These derivations, even if they produce different results upon re-execution, will be stored as part of a "digital mycelium" within a quasi meta-AI life simulation.

## Key Questions and Initial Thoughts:

1.  **Defining Task Derivations in Nix:**
    *   How would a task's inputs, outputs, and dependencies be represented in a `flake.nix` or `default.nix`?
    *   Consider using Rust, Lean4, MiniZinc, and LLVM via Nix for implementation.

2.  **Tracking Files for the Digital Mycelium:**
    *   What kind of metadata should be stored for each file?
    *   Where would this metadata be stored? (e.g., IPFS, Git, Hugging Face LFS datasets).

3.  **Conceptualizing the Meta-AI Life Simulation:**
    *   What would constitute "life" or "evolution" in this context?
    *   How would the AI life simulation interact with the Nix derivations?
    *   Consider each Git commit as a "heartbeat" of this evolving system.

## Next Steps:

*   Review other tasks in the project with this "digital mycelium" lens to identify potential integration points and further refine the concept.
