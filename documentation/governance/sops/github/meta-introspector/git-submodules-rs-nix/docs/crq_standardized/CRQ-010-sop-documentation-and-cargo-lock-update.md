# CRQ-010-SOP_and_Lock_File_Updates.md

## Change Request: SOP Documentation and Cargo.lock Update

### Objective

To document the addition of new Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) files and to commit the updated `Cargo.lock` file, ensuring that the project's dependency tree is accurately reflected and version controlled.

### Description

This CRQ covers two related updates:

1.  **New SOP Documents:** Several new SOP documents have been created to provide guidance on:
    *   Using `git-config-parser` (`SOP_Using_Git_Config_Parser.md`)
    *   Using `project_file_lattice_builder` (`SOP_Using_Project_File_Lattice_Builder.md`)
    *   Using `submodule-collector` (`SOP_Using_Submodule_Collector.md`)
    *   An integrated workflow for these binaries (`SOP_Integrated_Binary_Workflow.md`)

    These documents enhance the project's internal documentation and provide clear instructions for interacting with the developed tools.

2.  **`Cargo.lock` Update:** The `Cargo.lock` file has been updated as a result of adding the new `git-project-reader` crate and its dependencies to the workspace. This update ensures that all team members use the exact same versions of dependencies, promoting build consistency and reproducibility.

### Expected Outcome

*   All new SOP documents are committed and available in the `docs/sops/` directory.
*   The `Cargo.lock` file is updated to reflect the current, consistent state of project dependencies.
*   Improved project documentation and dependency management.

### Justification/Benefit

*   **Documentation Completeness:** Provides essential operational guidance for using key project binaries.
*   **Dependency Consistency:** Guarantees reproducible builds across different environments by locking dependency versions.
*   **Version Control Integrity:** Ensures that all project-related files, including dependency manifests, are properly tracked.

### Dependencies

*   Completion of the `git-project-reader` crate development.
*   Creation of the aforementioned SOP documents.
