# CRQ: Implement MiniZinc-Driven Deterministic Number Generation for Abulafia

## Description
Replace the current pseudo-random number generation in `eco_pendulum_indexer` (Abulafia) with a system where each "random" number is sampled from a MiniZinc solver. The MiniZinc solver will dynamically determine the "next best number" based on an optimization problem, incorporating the *entire state of the system* (memory, filesystem, active processes, etc.) as input, *influenced by the user's intent and the emergent principles of the Dao*. This moves away from a single seed to a continuous, context-aware number generation process, where each number is a solution derived from the current global system context.

## Justification
Aligns with the project's meta-narrative of complex, interconnected systems and the "Wagnerian Ring Structure." Provides a more sophisticated and conceptually rich "randomness" derived from the project's underlying structure.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   `eco_pendulum_indexer` no longer uses a traditional PRNG with a fixed seed.
*   The mechanism for generating numbers is demonstrably linked to a conceptual MiniZinc solver (even if simulated in the current implementation).
*   The output of Abulafia reflects the deterministic, yet dynamically "solved," nature of the number generation.

## Dependencies
*   Availability of a MiniZinc solver (conceptual for now, but required for full implementation).
*   Definition of "next best number" and "harmonic foldings" in a MiniZinc-compatible objective function.
