# CRQ: Standardize Task Documentation with SOPs and CRQs

## Purpose
This Change Request (CRQ) aims to establish a standardized format and content for all task documentation within the project. By adhering to a consistent structure, we can improve clarity, facilitate knowledge transfer, streamline task execution, and enhance overall project maintainability. This standardization will ensure that every task is clearly defined, its solution is well-documented, and its verification process is explicit.

## Key Principles
1.  **Clarity and Conciseness:** Task documentation should be easy to understand and free from ambiguity.
2.  **Completeness:** All necessary information for understanding, executing, and verifying a task must be present.
3.  **Adherence to SOPs:** Where applicable, task documentation must reference and align with existing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).
4.  **Traceability:** Each task should be traceable to its origin (e.g., a higher-level CRQ, a bug report, or a feature request).
5.  **Actionability:** Documentation should guide the reader through the task, providing clear steps and expected outcomes.

## Required Sections for Task Documentation

Every task documentation file (e.g., `task_*.md`) must include the following sections:

### 1. Task Title
A concise and descriptive title that clearly states the objective of the task.

### 2. Problem Statement
A detailed description of the problem or requirement that this task addresses. This section should explain *why* the task is necessary.

### 3. Proposed Solution
A clear and comprehensive outline of the steps and methodologies to be used to complete the task. This should include:
    *   **High-level approach:** A brief overview of the strategy.
    *   **Detailed steps:** Numbered or bulleted list of actions to be taken.
    *   **Technical considerations:** Any specific tools, libraries, or configurations required.

### 4. Verification
How the successful completion of the task will be verified. This can include:
    *   **Test cases:** Specific scenarios to test.
    *   **Expected outcomes:** What constitutes a successful result.
    *   **Validation steps:** Commands to run, logs to check, or behaviors to observe.

### 5. SOPs Referenced (if any)
A list of any Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that are relevant to this task. This ensures consistency with established project practices.

### 6. Related CRQs/Tasks (if any)
Links or references to other Change Requests or tasks that are related to this one, providing broader context.

## Example Task Documentation Structure

# Task: Implement User Authentication Module

## Problem Statement
The current system lacks a robust user authentication mechanism, leading to security vulnerabilities and an inability to differentiate user roles. This task aims to integrate a secure authentication module to manage user access and permissions.

## Proposed Solution
1.  **Choose Authentication Strategy:** Implement JWT-based authentication.
2.  **Develop API Endpoints:**
    *   `/api/auth/register`: User registration.
    *   `/api/auth/login`: User login, issuing a JWT.
    *   `/api/auth/profile`: Protected endpoint to retrieve user profile.
3.  **Integrate with Database:** Store user credentials (hashed passwords) and roles in the `users` table.
4.  **Implement Middleware:** Create middleware to validate JWTs for protected routes.
5.  **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for authentication failures.

## Verification
1.  **Unit Tests:** Run `cargo test` in the `auth_module` crate. All tests should pass.
2.  **Integration Tests:**
    *   Attempt to register a new user and verify database entry.
    *   Attempt to log in with valid credentials and verify JWT issuance.
    *   Attempt to access `/api/auth/profile` with a valid JWT. Expected: 200 OK and user data.
    *   Attempt to access `/api/auth/profile` without a JWT. Expected: 401 Unauthorized.
    *   Attempt to log in with invalid credentials. Expected: 401 Unauthorized.
3.  **Manual Testing:** Use `curl` or Postman to manually test all API endpoints.
