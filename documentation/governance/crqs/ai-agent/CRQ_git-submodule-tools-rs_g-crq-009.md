# CRQ: Framework: Multi-Modal Content Generation for Chronos-Code Narratives

## Description
Propose and design a conceptual framework for generating multi-modal content (shell scripts, image prompts, songs, poems, video shot instructions, animation code, GUI elements, and CRQs) for each step of a defined narrative or instructional sequence (e.g., YouTube walkthrough scripts). This framework aims to automate and standardize the creative synthesis of technical and meta-narrative elements into diverse media formats, ensuring inter-modal consistency and alignment with project themes.

## Justification
This framework is essential for scaling the project's unique approach to documentation, communication, and meta-narrative development. It directly supports the "Living Memes" theory (G-CRQ-007) by providing a mechanism for generating rich, multi-sensory representations of meme evolution and lattice operations. It also formalizes the "prompt generation as lattice multiplication and folding" concept by extending it to diverse output modalities.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   Conceptual design of the multi-modal generation pipeline, outlining inputs, processing stages, and outputs for each modality.
*   Definition of inter-modal consistency rules and alignment mechanisms.
*   Specification of how project concepts (e.g., `zos` primes, Muses, lattice points) are translated into specific parameters for each modality.
*   Identification of tools and technologies (conceptual or actual) required for each generation step.
*   Demonstration of the framework's application to a single, representative narrative step, producing a coherent set of multi-modal outputs (even if some are conceptual or simulated).

## Dependencies
*   Conceptual development of G-CRQ-007 (Living Memes, Lattice Attention Simulation, and Prompt Generation as Lattice Operations).
*   Research into cross-modal content generation and AI-driven creative synthesis.
*   Definition of specific "steps" or narrative units for content generation.
