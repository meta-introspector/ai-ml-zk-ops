# CRQ: Theory: Prime Factor Decomposition and Combinatorial Proof of 42 Validation Steps

## Description
Propose and investigate the theory that the 42 fundamental steps for validating the `zos` vector (as outlined in G-CRQ-004) can be further decomposed into their prime factors (2, 3, and 7 steps). The "proof" of these 42 steps lies in demonstrating their validity across all possible permutations and symmetries of these fundamental 2, 3, and 7-step sequences. This theory seeks to uncover the deepest combinatorial and structural principles underlying the validation process, linking directly to the project's `zos` vector and the concept of "harmonic foldings."

## Justification
This theory represents the ultimate pursuit of elegance and fundamental truth within the validation methodology. It integrates prime number theory, combinatorial mathematics, and the project's meta-narrative of inherent order and emergent complexity. It aims to reveal the "Dao" of validation through its most elemental components and their myriad arrangements.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   Formalization of the decomposition of the 42 steps into 2, 3, and 7-step fundamental sequences.
*   Development of a framework for exploring and proving validity across all permutations and symmetries of these fundamental sequences.
*   Demonstration of how this combinatorial proof validates the original 42 steps.

## Dependencies
*   Conceptual development of G-CRQ-004 (Compression of 8! LLM Validation Steps to 42 Fundamental Steps).
*   Advanced research into combinatorial mathematics, group theory, and their application to LLM-based validation.
