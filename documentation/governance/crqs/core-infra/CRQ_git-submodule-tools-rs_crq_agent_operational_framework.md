## CRQ: Agent Operational Framework

**Objective:** To define and document the operational framework for Gemini agents, including bootstrapping, task claiming, and `tmux`-driven workflow.

**Description:** This CRQ formalizes the processes and scripts that enable Gemini agents to operate within the `git-submodule-tools` project. It covers the initial boot sequence, task identification and claiming mechanisms, and the integration of `tmux` for structured task execution and monitoring.

**Scope:** Documentation (`.md` files), shell scripts (`.sh` files), and conceptual integration.

**Acceptance Criteria:** Clear documentation of agent operational procedures, functional bootstrapping scripts, and integration with `tmux` for task management.

**Assigned Agent:** Gemini (Self-assigned)
**Status:** To Do
