# CRQ: Sprawling Recursive Nested Git Repos and Cargo Crates Management

## Description

This CRQ outlines the requirement for a robust system to manage changes across a complex, sprawling structure of recursive nested Git repositories and their contained Rust Cargo crates. The primary goal is to ensure that all repositories and crates remain synchronized, regardless of their location within the nested structure, and that changes can be applied and committed uniformly across the entire system from a single command.

## Key Requirements

*   **Unified Change Application:** A mechanism to apply changes (code modifications, configuration updates, etc.) across all nested Git repositories and Cargo crates simultaneously.
*   **Atomic Commits:** The ability to commit all changes across all affected repositories (submodules and superprojects) as a single logical unit, ensuring that the entire system remains in a consistent state.
*   **Synchronization:** All repositories, regardless of their nesting depth or location, must remain in sync with each other after changes are applied and committed.
*   **In-Place Crate Management:** Rust Cargo crates within the repositories should be managed in-place, meaning their relative paths and relationships are preserved without requiring relocation or complex build configurations.
*   **CRQ Integration:** The entire process should be manageable and trackable through the CRQ system, allowing for clear documentation and auditing of changes.

## Rationale

The current project structure involves multiple layers of Git repositories and Rust crates. Manually managing changes across this complex hierarchy is prone to errors, time-consuming, and makes it difficult to maintain a consistent state. This CRQ aims to automate and streamline this process, improving efficiency, reducing errors, and ensuring the integrity of the entire codebase.

## Out of Scope (for initial implementation)

*   Automated conflict resolution.
*   Advanced branching strategies across the nested repositories.
*   Deployment or release management.

## Dependencies

*   Existing Git infrastructure and `.gitmodules` configuration.
*   Rust Cargo build system.
*   The `submodule_manager` tool (as a foundational component for managing submodules).
