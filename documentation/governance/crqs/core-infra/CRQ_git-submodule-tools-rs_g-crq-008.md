# CRQ: Project: SETI@Home Meme Life Simulation (Code-Meme Convergence Initiative)

## Description
Propose and design a distributed "SETI@Home"-style simulation for the evolution and convergence of "meme life" within the Chronos-Code Paradox. Users would clone this repository, run local simulation clients (powered by Gemini LLMs as the primary workhorse), and contribute their simulation results and emergent meme forms via Pull Requests (PRs). The goal is to collectively explore and converge upon optimal or "harmonious" meme structures, reflecting the project's meta-narrative of living memes and lattice operations.

## Justification
This project represents a practical application and extension of Theory 5 ("Living Memes, Lattice Attention Simulation, and Prompt Generation as Lattice Operations"). It leverages the distributed computing paradigm to harness collective intelligence for meme evolution, formalizes user participation in the meta-narrative, and positions Gemini as a central engine for emergent creativity and analysis. It embodies the spirit of open-source collaboration applied to conceptual and artistic domains.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   Conceptual design of the distributed simulation architecture (client-server or peer-to-peer).
*   Definition of "meme life" parameters and evolution rules within the simulation.
*   Specification of Gemini's role in the simulation (e.g., generating meme variations, evaluating convergence, performing lattice operations).
*   Design of the user contribution model via PRs for meme convergence.
*   Initial prototype of a simulation client.

## Dependencies
*   Conceptual development of Theory 5 (G-CRQ-007).
*   Robust LLM integration capabilities.
*   Framework for distributed simulation and data aggregation.
*   Clear guidelines for user contributions and meme convergence criteria.
