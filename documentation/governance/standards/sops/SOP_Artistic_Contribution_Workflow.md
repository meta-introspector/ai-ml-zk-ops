# SOP: The Artistic Contribution Workflow

*   **ID:** SOP-008
*   **Author:** Gemini
*   **Status:** Draft
*   **Related CRQ:** CRQ-021

## 1. Purpose

To provide a clear, step-by-step process for applying the project's Artistic Policy (`CRQ-021`) to all contributions, ensuring they are both technically sound and achieve "Aesthetic Resonance."

## 2. Scope

This SOP applies to all contributors and covers all forms of contribution, including but not limited to source code, scripts, documentation, and UI/UX design.

## 3. Procedure

The artistic contribution process follows "The Artificer's Cycle."

### 3.1. Step 1: Ideation (Meme-Storming)

*   **Objective:** Generate a creative idea that aligns with the "Muse Protocol."
*   **Action:**
    1.  Engage in individual or group "Meme-Storming."
    2.  Capture ideas, concepts, or potential "Functional Sonnets" in a personal log, a project `IDEAS.md` file, or a dedicated discussion forum.
    3.  The goal is to encourage "Spontaneous Innovation." Don't filter ideas at this stage.

### 3.2. Step 2: Proposal (Harmonious Contribution)

*   **Objective:** Propose the integration of a creative element.
*   **Action:**
    1.  For small changes (like a well-crafted "Code Poem" or use of "Commit Glyphs"), this step is implicit and requires no formal proposal.
    2.  For larger creative works (like a new UI/UX Sonnet or a significant documentation overhaul), open a discussion or issue to ensure the proposed work is a "Harmonious Contribution."

### 3.3. Step 3: Implementation (The Artificer's Process)

*   **Objective:** Create the "Executable Art."
*   **Action:**
    1.  **Code:** Write clean, elegant "Algorithmic Verse." Code should be as readable and well-structured as a poem.
    2.  **Documentation:** Write with clarity, precision, and a touch of the project's personality.
    3.  **Commits:** Adhere strictly to the "Commit Glyphs" legend to provide clear, symbolic context for every change.

### 3.4. Step 4: Review (Aesthetic Resonance Check)

*   **Objective:** Ensure the contribution aligns with the project's artistic standards.
*   **Action:**
    1.  When a contribution is submitted (e.g., via a pull request), it will be reviewed for both technical correctness and "Aesthetic Resonance."
    2.  Reviewers should ask: "Does this feel like it belongs in our Digital Canvas?" and "Is this a Harmonious Contribution?"
    3.  Feedback should be constructive and aim to elevate the artistic quality of the work.

## 4. Commit Glyph Legend

All commit messages should begin with a relevant "Commit Glyph."

*   ‚ú® `:sparkles:` - **New Feature:** When you introduce a new feature.
*   üêõ `:bug:` - **Bug Fix:** When you fix a bug.
*   üé® `:art:` - **Aesthetic Improvement:** When you improve the format, structure, or style of the code or documentation.
*   üìù `:memo:` - **Documentation:** When you write or update documentation.
*   üöÄ `:rocket:` - **Performance:** When you improve performance.
*   Nix `:snowflake:` - **Nix Flake/Config:** When you make changes to Nix flakes or configurations.
*   üßπ `:broom:` - **Refactor/Chore:** When you refactor code or perform housekeeping.
*   üß™ `:test_tube:` - **Testing:** When you add or update tests.
*   üîí `:lock:` - **Security:** When you address security vulnerabilities.
*   üèóÔ∏è `:building_construction:` - **Work in Progress:** For commits that are part of a larger feature under development.
