# CRQ-001: Add Quality Control Procedures

## 1. Introduction
This Change Request (CRQ-001) outlines the necessity and implementation plan for establishing robust quality control procedures across the project. The goal is to enhance code reliability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices, ultimately leading to a more stable and efficient development lifecycle.

## 2. Problem Statement
Currently, the project lacks formalized quality control mechanisms, leading to:
*   Inconsistent code style and quality.
*   Increased likelihood of bugs and regressions.
*   Higher maintenance overhead.
*   Challenges in onboarding new contributors due to varied code standards.

## 3. Proposed Solution
Implement a comprehensive quality control framework that includes:
*   **Code Linting:** Enforce consistent code style and identify potential errors early.
*   **Automated Testing:** Integrate unit, integration, and (where applicable) end-to-end tests.
*   **Code Review Guidelines:** Establish clear guidelines for peer code reviews.
*   **Documentation Standards:** Define standards for inline comments, function/module documentation, and external documentation (SOPs, CRQs).

## 4. Implementation Plan

### 4.1. Phase 1: Tooling and Configuration
*   **Identify and configure linting tools:** (e.g., `clippy` for Rust, `eslint` for JavaScript/TypeScript, `ruff` for Python).
*   **Integrate testing frameworks:** Ensure existing or new tests can be easily run and reported.
*   **Update CI/CD pipelines:** Incorporate linting and testing steps into automated workflows.

### 4.2. Phase 2: Documentation and Guidelines
*   **Develop SOPs for code review:** Document the process and expectations for code reviews.
*   **Create documentation guidelines:** Outline requirements for code comments, READMEs, and other project documentation.
*   **Draft initial SOPs for common development tasks.**

### 4.3. Phase 3: Training and Adoption
*   **Conduct workshops/training sessions:** Educate the team on new quality control procedures and tools.
*   **Monitor adoption and provide support:** Address any challenges or feedback during the initial rollout.

## 5. Success Metrics
*   Reduction in reported bugs post-implementation.
*   Improved code quality metrics (e.g., cyclomatic complexity, code coverage).
*   Increased consistency in code style across the codebase.
*   Positive feedback from development team regarding clarity and efficiency of new processes.

## 6. Dependencies
*   Availability of development resources for implementation and training.
*   Team buy-in and commitment to adopting new procedures.

## 7. Timeline
*   **Phase 1 (Tooling):** 2 weeks
*   **Phase 2 (Documentation):** 2 weeks
*   **Phase 3 (Training & Adoption):** Ongoing

## 8. Approval
This CRQ is submitted for review and approval by the project stakeholders.
