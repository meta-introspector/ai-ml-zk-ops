# SOP: Documentation Consolidation

## Purpose
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the process for consolidating project documentation from various sources into a unified, easily accessible platform, specifically integrating wiki content into the `zola`-generated main documentation.

## Scope
This SOP applies to all project documentation, including wikis, READMEs, and other informational assets.

## Procedure
1.  **Inventory Existing Documentation**: Identify all current sources of project documentation (e.g., `meta-meme.wiki`, `docs/` directory, inline code comments).
2.  **Content Assessment**: Review the content of each source for relevance, accuracy, and redundancy. Prioritize content for migration based on its importance and frequency of access.
3.  **Migration Strategy**: Develop a strategy for migrating content from its original format to a `zola`-compatible format (e.g., Markdown). This may involve manual conversion, scripting, or specialized tools.
4.  **Integration into Zola**: Integrate the migrated content into the `zola` project structure, ensuring proper organization, navigation, and cross-referencing.
5.  **Review and Validation**: Conduct a thorough review of the consolidated documentation to ensure accuracy, completeness, and correct rendering within `zola`.
6.  **Deprecation of Old Sources**: Once content is successfully migrated and validated, formally deprecate or archive the old documentation sources to prevent confusion.
7.  **Update Documentation Guidelines**: Revise and communicate documentation guidelines to reflect the new consolidated workflow, emphasizing the single source of truth principle.
