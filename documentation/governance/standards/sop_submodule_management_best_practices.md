# SOP: Submodule Management Best Practices

## Purpose
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines best practices for managing Git submodules within the project, focusing on optimizing repository size, build complexity, and dependency management.

## Scope
This SOP applies to all new and existing Git submodules integrated into the project.

## Procedure
1.  **Evaluate Necessity**: Before adding a new submodule, evaluate whether the entire external repository is truly necessary. Consider if only specific components or crates are required.
2.  **Prefer Cargo Dependencies**: If only specific Rust crates from an external repository are needed, prefer integrating them as direct Cargo dependencies rather than as a full submodule. This reduces repository size and simplifies build processes.
3.  **Automated Updates**: Implement automated checks (e.g., via CI/CD pipelines) to monitor for new commits in upstream submodule repositories. This ensures dependencies remain current and helps identify integration issues early.
4.  **Nix Flake Integration**: For enhanced reproducibility and streamlined dependency management within the Nix ecosystem, fully integrate submodules into Nix flakes.
5.  **Documentation**: Clearly document the purpose, usage, and maintenance procedures for each submodule.
