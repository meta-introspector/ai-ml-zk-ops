# SOP: Nix Expression Refactoring for Submodules

## Purpose
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides guidelines for refactoring Nix expressions that manage Git submodules, specifically focusing on making `submoduleUrl`, `submoduleRev`, and `submoduleSha256` configurable and manageable. This SOP leverages the concrete example provided in `reviewsubmodule.out1.md`.

## Scope
This SOP applies to all Nix expressions within the project that handle Git submodule checkouts and dependency management.

## Procedure
1.  **Identify Target Expression**: Locate the specific Nix expression (e.g., `flake.nix` or a module) that defines and manages a Git submodule. Refer to examples like the one in `reviewsubmodule.out1.md`.
2.  **Analyze Current Implementation**: Understand how `submoduleUrl`, `submoduleRev`, and `submoduleSha256` are currently defined and used within the expression, paying attention to `let` blocks and their scope.
3.  **Introduce Function Arguments**: Modify the Nix expression to accept `submoduleUrl` and `submoduleRev` as function arguments, allowing for dynamic configuration. This enhances the modularity and reusability of the expression.
4.  **Placeholder for `submoduleSha256`**: Replace the concrete `submoduleSha256` value with a placeholder (e.g., `""`, `"sha256-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA="`, or implement a mechanism to generate it dynamically if appropriate for the context).
5.  **Update Usage**: Adjust any parts of the Nix expression that consume these variables to use the newly introduced function arguments, ensuring consistency and correctness.
6.  **Refactor `let` Bindings**: If `submoduleUrl`, `submoduleRev`, or `submoduleSha256` were previously defined in a `let` block, refactor or remove those bindings as they are now passed as arguments, simplifying the expression.
7.  **Update Examples and Comments**: Ensure all example usage, inline comments (including those related to SOP compliance, mathematical anchoring, Nix-centric functions, reproducible LLM context, and digital mirroring), and associated documentation reflect the new configurable nature of the expression.
8.  **Testing**: Thoroughly test the refactored Nix expression to confirm that submodules are checked out correctly with the new arguments and that the overall build process remains functional and reproducible.
