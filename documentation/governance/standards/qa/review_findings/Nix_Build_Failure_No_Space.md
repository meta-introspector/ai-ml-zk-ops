# Nix Build Failure: No Space Left on Device

## Date: 2025-09-19

## Issue Description

The recent Nix build attempt for `template_generator_bin` failed with a critical error indicating that there is "No space left on device" in the Nix store or temporary build directory.

The full error message was:
```
error: creating file '/nix/store/tmp-10006-0/x/store/a45939hpa59y6a394wy1kdnglwljkqq3-gdbm-1.23/bin/gdbm_dump': No space left on device
```

Additionally, an ignored error about permissions was observed:
```
error (ignored): error: cannot unlink '/nix/store/tmp-10006-0/x/store/1r698f52kyvxys54b2dww9vv7q7fvxii-source/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/access_compat.load': Operation not permitted
```

## Impact

This issue prevents any further Nix builds or operations until sufficient disk space is freed.

## Resolution

To resolve this, you need to free up disk space in your Nix store. The standard way to do this is by running Nix garbage collection.

**Manual Steps Required by User:**

1.  **Clear Nix Store Garbage:** Execute the following command in your terminal to perform garbage collection and free up space in the Nix store:
    ```bash
    nix-collect-garbage -d
    ```
    This command will delete unreachable derivations and their outputs from the Nix store.

2.  **Check Disk Space (Optional but Recommended):** After running garbage collection, you can verify the available disk space using:
    ```bash
    df -h /nix/store
    ```
    or simply `df -h` to see overall disk usage.

Once you have freed up sufficient disk space, please instruct me to re-run the build.

## CRQ Association

This finding is associated with CRQ-017 (Nix-First Development and Immutable State Policy), as it highlights an environmental dependency for successful Nix operations.
