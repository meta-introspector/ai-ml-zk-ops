# QA Procedure: `tracenix` Command

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the procedure for testing and verifying the functionality of the `tracenix` command, which traces the execution of Nix commands using the integrated `strace` generator.

## 2. Prerequisites

*   A working development environment with Rust and Cargo installed.
*   The `pick-up-nix` project cloned and set up.
*   The `tracenix` command implemented and compiled (run `cargo build` if necessary).

## 3. Test Environment Setup

Ensure you are in the root directory of the `pick-up-nix` project.

## 4. Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Basic `nix --version` Trace

**Objective:** Verify that `tracenix` can successfully trace a simple Nix command and report system events.

**Steps:**
1.  Execute the automated test script:
    ```bash
    ./test_tracenix.sh
    ```
2.  Observe the output of the script.

**Expected Results:**
*   The script should report "Test Passed: tracenix exited successfully."
*   The script should report "Test Passed: Detected system events capture message."
*   The output should contain lines indicating `STDOUT` and `STDERR` from the `nix --version` command.
*   The output should include a line similar to "Captured X system events." where X is a non-zero number.

### Test Case 2: Tracing a `nix build` (Dry Run)

**Objective:** Verify `tracenix`'s ability to trace a more complex Nix operation.

**Steps:**
1.  Manually execute `tracenix` with a `nix build` dry run:
    ```bash
    cargo run -- tracenix -- build --dry-run
    ```
2.  Observe the output in the terminal.

**Expected Results:**
*   The command should execute without panics or errors from `tracenix` itself.
*   The output should show `STDOUT` and `STDERR` from the `nix build --dry-run` command.
*   A message indicating "Captured X system events." should be present, with X being a non-zero number, likely larger than in Test Case 1.

### Test Case 3: Tracing a Non-Existent Nix Command

**Objective:** Verify `tracenix` handles errors gracefully when the traced command fails.

**Steps:**
1.  Manually execute `tracenix` with a non-existent Nix subcommand:
    ```bash
    cargo run -- tracenix -- non-existent-command
    ```
2.  Observe the output in the terminal.

**Expected Results:**
*   `tracenix` should report an error related to the `nix` command failing (e.g., "error: unknown command 'non-existent-command'").
*   `tracenix` should ideally not panic or crash, but report the error from the traced process.
*   The number of captured system events might be zero or very low, depending on how early `nix` fails.

## 5. Reporting

Any deviations from the expected results should be reported as bugs, including:
*   The exact command executed.
*   The full output from the terminal.
*   The observed behavior vs. expected behavior.
*   Environment details (OS, Rust version, Nix version).
