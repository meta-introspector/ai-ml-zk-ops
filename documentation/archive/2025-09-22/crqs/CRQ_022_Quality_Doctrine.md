# CRQ-022: Project Quality Doctrine

*   **Status:** Proposed
*   **Author:** Gemini
*   **Date:** 2025-09-21

## 1. Problem Statement

As the project grows in complexity and scope, there is a need for a clear, overarching set of principles to guide all development, documentation, and operational activities. Without a formal "Quality Doctrine," there is a risk of inconsistency, inefficiency, and a lack of auditable processes, which can hinder the project's core vision of "Self-Proving Intelligence."

## 2. Proposed Solution

Establish a comprehensive "Quality Doctrine" that defines the fundamental principles governing all aspects of the project. This doctrine will ensure consistency, reproducibility, and adherence to high standards across all contributions.

## 3. Scope

This doctrine applies to all project activities, including but not limited to: software development, documentation, process definition, change management, and operational procedures.

## 4. The Quality Doctrine

The following principles constitute the Project Quality Doctrine:

1.  **All Intent is Documented as Change Requests (CRQs):** Every significant intention, proposed change, or new feature must be formally initiated and tracked through a Change Request. This ensures transparency, reviewability, and a clear historical record of decision-making.
2.  **All Procedures Follow Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** All recurring tasks, operational workflows, and technical procedures must be clearly defined and executed according to approved Standard Operating Procedures. This guarantees consistency, reduces errors, and facilitates onboarding.
3.  **Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY):** This principle applies to code, documentation, and processes. Redundancy should be actively identified and eliminated to improve maintainability, reduce cognitive load, and enhance efficiency.
4.  **All Changes to SOPs Follow Meta-SOPs:** The process for modifying or creating new SOPs must itself adhere to a higher-level set of procedures, referred to as "Meta-SOPs." These Meta-SOPs will draw upon established industry standards to ensure rigor and quality in process management.

## 5. Meta-SOPs and Referenced Standards

The Meta-SOPs for managing our Standard Operating Procedures will be informed by, and aim to align with, the following industry best practices and frameworks:

*   **ISO 9000 (ISO9k):** Quality management systems, focusing on customer satisfaction and continuous improvement.
*   **Six Sigma (6Sigma):** A data-driven approach and methodology for eliminating defects and improving processes.
*   **IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL):** A framework for IT service management, emphasizing service lifecycle and continuous improvement.
*   **C4 Model (C4):** A hierarchical approach to software architecture documentation, ensuring clarity and consistency.
*   **Unified Modeling Language (UML):** A standardized system for visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of a software-intensive system.
*   **Free Software Foundation (FSF) Principles:** Guiding principles for free software, promoting transparency, collaboration, and user freedom.
*   **Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP):** Quality systems for manufacturing, ensuring products are consistently produced and controlled according to quality standards.
*   **Observe, Orient, Decide, Act (OODA) Loop:** A decision cycle for rapid decision-making and adaptation, applicable to process iteration and improvement.

## 6. Impact

Adopting this Quality Doctrine will:
*   Enhance the overall quality and reliability of the project.
*   Improve consistency across all contributions.
*   Increase the auditability and reproducibility of processes.
*   Foster a culture of continuous improvement and adherence to best practices.
*   Directly support the project's vision of "Self-Proving Intelligence" by ensuring that every step of the OODA loop is auditable and reproducible.

## 7. Rollback Plan

This CRQ introduces a set of principles and does not involve direct code changes. If the doctrine proves unworkable or counterproductive, this CRQ can be marked as "Rejected" or "Deprecated," and the project can revert to less formalized quality guidelines.
