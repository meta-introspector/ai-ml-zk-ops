# CRQ: Automate Submodule Updates

## Request
This Change ReQuest proposes the implementation of automated checks to monitor for new commits in upstream submodule repositories. The goal is to ensure that project dependencies remain current and to facilitate early identification of potential integration issues.

## Justification
Automating submodule updates will:
- Reduce manual effort in keeping submodules up-to-date.
- Improve project stability by quickly identifying breaking changes in upstream dependencies.
- Enhance the overall reliability of the build and deployment process.

## Scope
- Research and selection of appropriate tools/methods for automated monitoring.
- Design and implementation of a CI/CD workflow for submodule update checks.
- Documentation of the automated process.

## Origin
`reviewsubmodule_task2.md.out`
