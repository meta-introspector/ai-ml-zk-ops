# CRQ-0001: Pureify System Core in Nix

## 1. Overview

This Change Request (CRQ) proposes the "pureification" of the system core using Nix. The goal is to encapsulate critical system components and processes within Nix derivations, ensuring reproducibility, immutability, and auditable provenance for the entire system core.

## 2. Problem Statement

The current system core may contain imperative scripts, non-reproducible build processes, and implicit dependencies that hinder reliability, auditability, and maintainability. This lack of purity makes it challenging to guarantee consistent behavior across environments, verify the integrity of the system, and efficiently debug issues.

## 3. Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive strategy to pureify the system core by:

*   **Encapsulating all system core components as Nix derivations:** This includes services, configurations, and essential binaries.
*   **Defining explicit dependencies:** All dependencies will be declared within Nix expressions, eliminating implicit reliance on the host environment.
*   **Ensuring immutability:** Once built, system core components will be immutable, preventing runtime modifications and ensuring consistent behavior.
*   **Leveraging Nix's content-addressable store:** This will provide cryptographic guarantees of component integrity and enable efficient caching.
*   **Converting imperative shell scripts into functional JSON wranglers:** This involves transforming shell-based logic into declarative Nix expressions that process structured data (e.g., JSON) to generate configurations and artifacts, enhancing reproducibility and auditability.

## 4. Scope

This CRQ focuses on the core components essential for system operation. Specific areas to be pureified include:

*   [List specific system core components, e.g., boot processes, core services, critical configurations]

## 5. Technical Details

*   **Nix Flakes:** Utilize Nix flakes for defining and managing the pureified system core, enabling easier integration and consumption by other projects.
*   **NixOS Modules (if applicable):** Leverage NixOS modules for declarative system configuration.
*   **Existing Tools:** Integrate with existing Nix tools and best practices.

## 6. Testing and Verification

*   **Unit Tests:** Develop unit tests for individual Nix derivations to ensure correctness.
*   **Integration Tests:** Implement integration tests to verify the interaction of pureified components.
*   **Deployment Verification:** Ensure the pureified system core deploys and functions as expected in various environments.

## 7. Rollback Plan

In case of unforeseen issues, the rollback plan involves reverting to the previous, non-pureified system core configuration. This will be achieved by [describe rollback mechanism, e.g., Git revert, NixOS rollback].

## 8. Estimated Effort and Timeline

[Provide estimated effort and timeline for implementation]

## 10. Open Questions and Dependencies

*   [List any open questions or external dependencies]
