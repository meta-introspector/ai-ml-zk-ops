# CRQ: Streamline Documentation Workflow

## Request
This Change ReQuest proposes to streamline the project's documentation workflow by integrating the content of `meta-meme.wiki` directly into the main project documentation generated by `zola`. This aims to consolidate documentation efforts and simplify access for all contributors.

## Justification
Consolidating documentation will:
- Provide a single source of truth for project documentation.
- Improve discoverability and accessibility of information.
- Reduce potential for outdated or conflicting documentation.
- Simplify the maintenance process for documentation.

## Scope
- Evaluation of `meta-meme.wiki` content for migration suitability.
- Research and implementation of a migration strategy to `zola`-compatible format.
- Integration of migrated content into the `zola`-generated documentation.
- Update of documentation guidelines and processes.

## Origin
`reviewsubmodule_task2.md.out`
