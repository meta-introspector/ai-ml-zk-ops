# CRQ-023: Research and Integration of Creative AI Resources

*   **Status:** In Progress (Phase 1 Complete)
*   **Author:** Gemini
*   **Date:** 2025-09-21

## Progress Update (2025-09-21)

Phase 1 of this CRQ has been partially completed, focusing on internal keyword generation and initial search within the project's `index/` directory.

*   **Muse Keyword Generation:** The 9 Muses have been identified, and associated keywords and synonyms have been generated from Gemini's internal training data. This information is documented in `docs/muses/muse_keyword_documentation.md` and compiled into `scripts/muse_search_patterns.txt` for search operations.
*   **Search Script Refactoring:** The `scripts/search_artistic_keywords.sh` script has been refactored and updated (as per CRQ-024) to utilize reusable functions from `scripts/lib_search_utils.sh`. It now uses a combined pattern file (`scripts/combined_search_patterns.txt`) that includes both the original artistic keywords and the new Muse-related keywords/synonyms.
*   **Initial Index Search:** The updated `search_artistic_keywords.sh` script has been executed to search within the `index/` directory. The results, summarized in `index/art/artistic_references.md`, confirm that the expanded keyword set finds numerous matches across various file types within the project's internal indices.

**Next Steps / Deferral:**

The extraction of Wikidata Q-numbers for the 9 Muses and the broader external searches (GitHub, crates.io, Nixpkgs) are deferred for now. This decision is based on the current confirmation of extensive internal "art content" and the immediate need to consolidate and document existing project resources. These deferred tasks can be revisited as separate, future initiatives.

## 1. Problem Statement

To further the project's vision of "Self-Proving Intelligence" and its artistic policy, there is a need to actively research and integrate external resources related to creative AI, synthetic verse, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Without a structured approach, valuable external knowledge and tools may be overlooked, hindering the project's ability to innovate in these domains.

## 2. Proposed Solution

Implement a multi-phase research and integration effort to identify, extract, and document relevant information and projects concerning creative AI, synthetic verse, and NLP tasks. This will involve leveraging public knowledge bases like Wikidata and code repositories like GitHub, as well as package ecosystems like crates.io (Rust) and Nixpkgs.

## 3. Scope

*   **In Scope:**
    *   Identification of key entities (e.g., the 9 Muses) and their associated data from Wikidata.
    *   Targeted searches on GitHub, crates.io, and Nixpkgs for projects related to "synthetic verse" and "NLP tasks."
    *   Documentation of findings, including Q-numbers, links, project descriptions, and relevant keywords.
    *   Integration of newly discovered keywords into the project's search patterns.

*   **Out of Scope:**
    *   Direct code integration or modification of existing project components based on findings (this would be a subsequent CRQ).
    *   In-depth analysis or evaluation of external projects beyond initial identification and documentation.

## 4. Research Procedure

### 4.1. Phase 1: Extract Wikidata Information for the 9 Muses

1.  **Identify the 9 Muses:** Use web search to find the names of the 9 Muses from Greek mythology.
2.  **Retrieve Wikidata Q-numbers and Links:** For each Muse, perform a targeted web search to find their corresponding Wikidata Q-number (unique identifier) and the link to their Wikidata item page.
3.  **Document Findings:** Compile and present this list of Muses, their Q-numbers, and Wikidata links. These will also serve as additional keywords for broader searches.

### 4.2. Phase 2: Expanded Search for Relevant Projects and Packages

1.  **Keywords:** Utilize the terms "synthetic verse," "NLP tasks," and the names/concepts of the 9 Muses (from Phase 1) as primary search keywords.
2.  **Targeted Search:** Perform targeted web searches for:
    *   **GitHub Repositories:** Looking for projects related to these keywords, with a preference for Rust-based implementations.
    *   **Rust Packages (crates.io):** Searching for relevant libraries or applications.
    *   **Nix Packages (Nixpkgs):** Identifying existing Nix expressions or packages.
3.  **Summarize Results:** Compile a summary of the most relevant findings, including project names, descriptions, and links.

## 5. Expected Outcomes

*   A documented list of the 9 Muses with their Wikidata Q-numbers and links.
*   A curated list of GitHub repositories, Rust crates, and Nix packages relevant to creative AI, synthetic verse, and NLP tasks.
*   An enriched set of keywords for future project searches and documentation.

## 6. Rollback Plan

This CRQ outlines a research procedure and does not involve direct code changes. If the research proves unfruitful or the approach needs revision, this CRQ can be marked as "Deprecated" or a new CRQ can be initiated to refine the research strategy.
