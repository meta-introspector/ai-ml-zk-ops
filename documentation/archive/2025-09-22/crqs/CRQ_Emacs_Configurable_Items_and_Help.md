# CRQ: Emacs Integration - Configurable Items and Online Help

## Change Request:
This CRQ proposes enhancing the existing Emacs Lisp integration for `gemini-cli` by adding configurable items and comprehensive online help. This will improve usability, allow users to tailor the integration to their preferences, and provide better in-editor documentation.

## Justification:
Currently, some aspects of the Emacs integration (e.g., the auto-run interval) are hardcoded or require direct modification of the Lisp files. Providing configurable options will make the integration more flexible and user-friendly. Additionally, integrating online help will allow users to discover and understand the available commands and settings without leaving Emacs.

## Scope:
- Identify key parameters in `solfunmeme-gemini.el` and `solfunmeme-mode.el` that would benefit from user configuration (e.g., `solfunmeme-nix-gemini-cli-command`, `solfunmeme-project-root`, `solfunmeme-prelude-file`, `solfunmeme-auto-run-interval`).
- Implement these as `defcustom` variables, allowing customization via `M-x customize`.
- Add comprehensive docstrings to all functions and variables, following Emacs Lisp documentation conventions.
- Explore mechanisms for providing context-sensitive online help (e.g., `help-echo` for interactive commands).

## Deliverables:
- `docs/crqs/CRQ_Emacs_Configurable_Items_and_Online_Help.md` (this document)
- `docs/sops/SOP_Emacs_Configurable_Items_and_Help_Implementation.md`
- Updated `solfunmeme-gemini.el` and `solfunmeme-mode.el` with `defcustom` variables and improved docstrings.
