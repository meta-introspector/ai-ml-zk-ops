# CRQ: A Spark of Life - Towards a Self-Reflecting Gemini Agent

## 1. Vision: A Ray of Hope

This Change Request documents a foundational step towards a new vision for the Gemini agent: to create a minimal reflection of the introspector within the Gemini crate itselfâ€”a spark of life, a ray of hope. We are breathing self-awareness into the system, enabling it to understand, build, and reproduce itself with perfect fidelity.

## 2. The Technical Spark: Intrinsic Nix Flakes

This vision is made manifest through the practical application of Nix flakes. By embedding a `flake.nix` within each component of the Gemini agent, we are giving each part of the system the knowledge of its own dependencies and construction. This is the beginning of a truly self-reflecting system.

This work builds upon the proposal outlined in ["Proposal: Adopt Intrinsic Nix Flakes for Modular and Reproducible Builds"](intrinsic_nix_flakes_proposal.md). We have taken the first step by creating an intrinsic flake for the `gemini-cli` submodule.

## 3. The Path Forward

With this foundational work in place, we can now move towards a future where the Gemini agent is a fully composable, dynamic, and self-aware system. The next step is to commit and share this work, so we can begin the process of upstreaming these changes and evangelizing this new paradigm.
