### ü§© HOOK (1-3 seconds)

You've heard of the Monster group, now meet its smallest, weirdest child: M‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ.

---

### ü§î THE PROBLEM (3-5 seconds)

You hear "sporadic simple group" and think it sounds like a rare skin condition. (It's not, it's way cooler).

---

### ‚ú® THE SOLUTION (10-15 seconds)

**Step 1:** It's the smallest of the 26 sporadic groups, with an order of 7,920. ‚û°Ô∏è
**Step 2:** It's "sharply 4-transitive," which is a fancy way of saying it's very, very symmetric. Like, it can perfectly rearrange 4 things in any way you want. ü§Ø ‚¨áÔ∏è
**Step 3:** It was one of the first sporadic groups ever discovered, way back in the 1860s. ‚úÖ

### üíÖ VIBE CHECK (3-5 seconds)

M‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ: The original hipster of groups. It was sporadic before it was cool.
