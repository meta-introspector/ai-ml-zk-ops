### ✨ THE SOLUTION (10-15 seconds)

**Step 1:** A Keith number is a number that appears in a sequence that starts with its own digits. ➡️
**Step 2:** Let's take 197. The sequence starts with 1, 9, 7. ⬇️
**Step 3:** The next number is the sum of the previous three: 1 + 9 + 7 = 17. Then 9 + 7 + 17 = 33. Then 7 + 17 + 33 = 57. Then 17 + 33 + 57 = 107. And finally, 33 + 57 + 107 = 197! ✅
**Step 4:** It's a Keith number! 🎉
