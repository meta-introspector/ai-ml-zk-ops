### 🤔 THE PROBLEM (3-5 seconds)

You think prime numbers are just for math class. 🤓 But what if they hold cosmic secrets? 🌌

---

### ✨ THE SOLUTION (10-15 seconds)

**Step 1:** It's the 10th prime number and a twin prime with 31! 🔢 ➡️
**Step 2:** It's the smallest positive whole number that *cannot* be formed from {1, 2, 3, 4} using basic operations. Mind. Blown. 🤯 ⬇️
**Step 3:** It's the sum of three consecutive squares: 2² + 3² + 4² = 29! ✅
**Step 4:** It's a Sophie Germain prime, a Lucas prime, a Pell prime, and a tetranacci number. Plus, it's the number of days in February during a leap year! 🗓️ 🎉
