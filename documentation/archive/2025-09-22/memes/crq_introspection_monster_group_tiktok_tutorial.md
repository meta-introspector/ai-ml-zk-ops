### 🤩 HOOK (1-3 seconds)

What if the biggest math monster holds the secret to building the most complex systems ever? 🤯

---

### 🤔 THE PROBLEM (3-5 seconds)

You're trying to design a super complex system, but you're stuck. 😩 What if math has the answer? 🔢

---

### ✨ THE SOLUTION (10-15 seconds)

**Step 1:** This CRQ is about exploring the **Monster Group** – the largest sporadic simple group. 👾 ➡️
**Step 2:** We're looking into how its properties (like its immense symmetry and complexity) can inspire new ways to design **abstract data structures** or **highly complex systems**. 🏗️ ⬇️
**Step 3:** It's about finding **novel frameworks** for understanding and modeling systems with extreme complexity. 🧠 ✅
**Step 4:** Think of it as using the "Monster" as a blueprint for future tech.  blueprints 🎉
