### 🤩 HOOK (1-3 seconds)

It's a prime, a safe prime, and a number with a secret society? Why is 47 so mysterious? 🕵️‍♀️✨

---

### 🤔 THE PROBLEM (3-5 seconds)

You think prime numbers are just for encryption. 🔒 But what if they hold deeper secrets? 🤫

---

### ✨ THE SOLUTION (10-15 seconds)

**Step 1:** It's a prime number, and a safe prime (meaning 2p+1 is also prime). 🔢 ➡️
**Step 2:** It's the *last* consecutive prime number that divides the order of at least one sporadic group. That's a big deal in math! 🤯 ⬇️
**Step 3:** The "47 phenomenon" at Pomona College: students found it everywhere, a professor "proved" it equal to all other integers, and it's deliberately inserted into pop culture (e.g., *Star Trek*). 🖖📚 ✅
**Step 4:** For some, it represents the "perfect expression of balance" between heart and brain. ☯️ 🎉
