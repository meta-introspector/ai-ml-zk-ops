# Index Creation Documentation

This document outlines the process of creating and populating the file index within the project.

## 1. Extraction of Unique File Extensions

**Objective:** To identify and list all unique file extensions present in `files.txt`.

**Process:**
A shell script named `generate_extensions_index.sh` was created and executed. This script performs the following operations:
*   Reads the content of `/data/data/com.termux.nix/files/home/pick-up-nix2/files.txt`.
*   Pipes the content through a series of text processing utilities (`grep`, `sed`, `cut`, `sort -u`) to extract strings that appear after the last dot in each file path. These strings are treated as file extensions.
    *   `grep '\.'`: Filters lines that contain at least one dot.
    *   `sed -E 's/^.*\///'`: Removes the directory path, leaving only the filename.
    *   `cut -d'.' -f2-`: Extracts everything after the first dot in the filename (this handles multi-part extensions like `.tar.gz`).
    *   `sed -E 's/^.*\.([^.]+)$/\1/'`: Further refines the extraction to get only the last part of the extension (e.g., `gz` from `tar.gz`).
    *   `sort -u`: Sorts the extracted extensions alphabetically and removes duplicates.
*   The final list of unique extensions is redirected and saved to `/data/data/com.termux.nix/files/home/pick-up-nix2/index/extensions.txt`.

## 2. Splitting `files.txt` into Chunks by Extension

**Objective:** To create separate files, each containing file paths corresponding to a specific extension.

**Process:**
A shell script named `split_files_by_extension.sh` was created and executed. This script performs the following steps:
*   Creates a new directory: `/data/data/com.termux.nix/files/home/pick-up-nix2/index/chunks/`.
*   Reads each unique extension from `/data/data/com.termux.nix/files/home/pick-up-nix2/index/extensions.txt` line by line.
*   For each `extension` read:
    *   It uses `grep -E "\\.$extension$"` to search the original `/data/data/com.termux.nix/files/home/pick-up-nix2/files.txt` for lines that end with a literal dot followed by the current `extension`.
    *   The matching lines are then redirected and saved to a new file within the `index/chunks/` directory, named after the extension (e.g., `/data/data/com.termux.nix/files/home/pick-up-nix2/index/chunks/txt.txt`).

## Search Attempts for "template task generate"

During this process, searches were performed for the string "template task generate":
*   In all `.sh` files across the project: No matches were found.
*   In all files within the `/data/data/com.termux.nix/files/home/pick-up-nix2/index/` directory: No matches were found.
